Unfortunately, criminals are developing new malware that can evade this technology. If such malware detects the signs of VM environment, it remains inactive until they are outside of the sandbox. Experts predicted that in 2018 we would see an increasing number of cyber attacks performed with sandbox-evading. However, the epidemic has actually started two years ago. Let’s look at the most recent attacks that were successful because modern security solutions weren’t able to detect sandbox-evading malware.\n",

            "Since early March 2018, there have been cases of attacks performed with the RIG Exploit Kit that infects victims with a backdoor trojan called Grobios. This malware is packed with PECompact 2.xx that allows it to evade static detection. Though the unpacked file has no functions, it uses hashing to obfuscate the names of API functions it invokes. It also divides the PE header of the DLL files to match the name of a function to its hash. In addition, the trojan performs a series of checks to become aware of its environment. Particularly, it looks for virtual machine software, like Hyper-V or VMWare, a username with the words “malware”, “sandbox”, or “maltest”, and compares the driver names with its blacklist of VM drivers.\n",

            "This banking trojan attacks users mainly in Europe through spam sent via MailChimp since 2017. It steals the credentials of bank’s customers and manipulates their online sessions. Before installation, the malware uses a dropper to become aware of its environment. Thus, the dropper looks for specific names in the Windows Registry and virtual machine resources on disk. It also checks the device’s BIOS to discover whether there is a virtual machine client installation and examines the machine’s MAC address. If the dropper doesn’t find any signs of the sandbox, the virus payload is executed and GootKit trojan carries out additional checks, like looking for hard drives, CPU names that confirm a physical machine, and virtual machine values.\n",

            "It’s hard to believe that when it was originally launched in 2002, Crocs were intended just as a humble boating shoe. In the 16 years that have followed though, the perennial ugly shoe has cemented itself as a staple for chefs, toddlers, hospital staff, your dad, and now, finally, it’s been embraced by the fashion world. Our love for Crocs has grown so exponentially that it looks like, despite its obvious aesthetic issues (say what you want about them, but they’re ugly), they won’t be going anywhere for quite some time. We are, in short, obsessed with the Croc.\n",
            "\n",
            "Collectively, in fact, we’re now so obsessed with the humble shoe that stock in the company is supposedly more lucrative than Bitcoin. New York Times reporter Jack Nicas shared a graph on Twitter that showed the price change for both Crocs and the cryptocurrency over the past year. His figures highlighted that, while it’s true bitcoin stock peaked higher than Crocs over the course of the year -- it increased by a massive 300% -- Crocs are a more valuable long term investment, doubling over the past 12 months. “Let’s give it up for the plastic cobbler who could!” Jack wrote.\n",
            "\n",
            "In 2016, Crocs officially crossed over into high fashion, making their catwalk debut at Christopher Kane’s spring/summer 17 show. Part of an official collaboration, Christopher Kane’s wet-look, geode encrusted crocs immediately divided opinion. In fact the footwear proved so controversial that the designer was forced to make a statement defending them. “Crocs are great. I love them”, he said unequivocally when challenged. “I don’t care what anyone else thinks. I don’t think anyone’s got the right to say right or wrong, unless they’re God. Otherwise just shut up.”\n",
            "\n",
            "“I knew people were going to react in that way,” he continued. “But it wasn’t about being controversial. Obviously people do like them, and that’s a different customer I want to grab. I want to include everyone and not be a snob.”\n",
            "\n",
            "Joining in in the fight against fashion snobbery, Demna Gvasalia’s autumn/winter 17 Balenciaga collection came complete with towering, garish platform Crocs. Despite (yet again) dividing the internet and the fashion world, Crocs themselves were very into the collaboration. “Working with Balenciaga has been so much fun for our team”, Senior VP Michelle Poole said at the time. “When Balenciaga approached us we were intrigued by the opportunity to push the boundaries of our design and moulding capabilities to see what we could create together.” What they created together was, obviously, the zenith of Croc’s ugly-cool anti-aesthetic appeal.\n",
            "\n",
            "It’s not just high fashion that’s in the midst of a Croc love affair either. A recent report by eBay found that, this April alone, there were 25,000 searches for Crocs across the site, and 15,000 sold. That equates to about 20 pairs an hour. That is, it has to be said, an awful lot of Crocs. Far from being the reserve of fashion bloggers, i.e. a piece that’s inaccessible and unwearable, Crocs are the ordinary person’s shoe. They’re equally at home on the catwalk or the sofa. They’re so beloved by the everyman, in fact, that when news broke that the company was shutting down their last manufacturing facility in Italy, social media went into overdrive in sharing their heartbreak. “SAVE OUR CROCS”, wrote one fan, while another tweeted: “I guess this is what heartbreak feels like.” The backlash was so huge that Crocs were forced to release a statement confirming that they weren’t going out of business but instead ‘streamlining’ their manufacturing processes. “Take comfort, #CrocNation. Our future remains as bright, bold and colourful as ever”, they reassured devoted fans across the world.\n",
            "\n",
            "It wasn’t always like this. In the early years Crocs were nothing short of reviled. In 2006, four years after the company launched, a Washington Post article compared the shoes to “vermin”, branding them “hideous”. A year later Maxim listed Crocs as number six on the top ten worst things to happen to men in 2007, while in 2010, Time Magazine listed Crocs as one of the “50 worst inventions” ever. A Facebook page called ‘I don’t care how comfortable Crocs are, you look like a dumbass’ has amassed a staggering 1.2 million fans. How then, did the optics change so drastically? How did Crocs going from being reviled to being a must have fashion item?\n",
            "\n",
            "Partly it’s down to endorsement -- from both fashion houses and from celebrities. While they may have been vilified on social media, Christopher Kane and Balenciaga’s Crocs have changed the perception of the shoe from comfortable-but-ugly to expensive-but-fashionable. In the years preceding their collaborations with the divisive clog, Crocs appeared on the feet of the rich and powerful. George W. Bush, Michelle Obama and Prince George have all been spotted in them, the latter sparking a 1500% rise in searches for the shoe on Amazon, the so called “Prince George effect”. Partly the rise of the Croc is probably also down to noughties nostalgia. It’s the latest dubious trend from the 2000s to make an anti-aesthetic comeback, after Juicy Couture’s iconic velour tracksuits returned to NYFW, and Jeremy Scott reinvented the ultimate noughties cool girl shoe, the Ugg boot.\n",
            "\n",
            "More than endorsement and nostalgia though, I would argue that we only have ourselves to blame for the world’s current love affair with Crocs. It’s our fault. We reacted so viscerally against the Croc in the early stages of its life, directed so much public vitriol towards the Croc that eventually, the pendulum had swung so far in one direction it had nowhere else to go but the whole way back. As a sort of opposite milkshake duck scenario, we hated Crocs so much that eventually, we could only grow to love them.\n",

            "Soon after becoming Supreme Pontiff, Pope Francis wrote a preface to Poor for the Poor, a book by Cardinal Gerhard Müller, published by the Vatican. In the Pope’s words: “This is a great truth. Money is a tool that in some way — such as property – extends and enhances the capabilities of human freedom, allowing it to operate in the world, to act, to bear fruit. In itself it is a good tool; like almost all the things that man has at his disposition, it expands our opportunities.”\n",
            "\n",
            "Like many other moralists Pope Francis cautioned that the same tool can be used for evil goals. The above paragraph, although published in a book with all the ecclesiastical approvals, received minimal attention.

            "Even before Christianity, and Jesus’ famous use of a coin (denarius) to teach a lesson (Mark 12:16), philosophers have had been studying the moral aspects of money with great care. I was able to review this field thanks to an invitation to speak about monetary policy and ethics at Libera Università di Lingue e Comunicazione, or IULM, a university in Milan that has been growing in reputation and in number of talented students. The invitation came from Professor Angelo Miglietta and Alberto Mingardi, the founder and leader of Instituto Bruno Leoni, and an assistant professor at IULM. Given the many ethical questions involving monetary creation and manipulation, I asked Mingardi, “What should the main topic be?” He answered “Aquinas and Bitcoin.” I took the challenge.\n",
            "\n",
            "Monetary topics are some of the first economic issues to be studied with some rigor. Since the first writings by the Greek philosophers, such as Plato, Aristotle, Hesiod and Xenophon, and until the 16th century, the moral questions, “what is good, what is bad?” dominated the approach of those who studied human action. To be able to judge if a certain monetary issue is good or bad, moral philosophers first had to answer questions that went beyond morality, such as:\n",
            "\n",
            "What is money? What determines its value? What are the impacts of changes in its value? What factors influence supply and demand?\n",
            "\n",
            "In doing so, they were acting as pure economists.\n",
            "\n",
            "Scholars of the late Middle Ages developed their theory of money in accordance with Aristotelian teachings. They believed that the inconveniences of barter gave rise to the need for money. The essential function of money is to serve as a medium of exchange. St. Thomas Aquinas (1225-1274) reminded his readers that “money . . . according to Aristotle, was invented chiefly for exchanges to be made, so that the prime and proper use of money is its use and disbursement in the way of ordinary transactions.” Money could also be used as a store of value and as a measure for exchanges. These two functions, however, depended on the essence of money (i.e., money as the most commonly used medium of exchange).\n",
            "\n",
            "After Aquinas, one of the first to write about money was Nicole Oresme (c. 1320-1382), the great multifaceted scientist, who later in his life became Bishop of Lisieux, a city and commune in Normandy, France. His book on money, De origine, natura, jure et mutationibus monetarum, Traité de la Première Invention des Monnoies, (usually translated as A Treatise on the Origin, Nature, Law, and Alteration of Money) has valuable lessons even for today. It was one of the first works focusing solely on an economic topic.\n",
            "\n",
            "He first wrote about Creation and the diverse resources around the globe: \"When the most high and sovereign God Almighty divided the nations and separated the sons of Adam, he set boundaries for the people, according to the number of the children of Israel; thence in the course of time men multiplied over the earth, and their possessions were divided and shared among them, as was expedient. Thus it came about that one man had more of one thing in his possession than his needs required while another little or none of the same thing, but on the contrary had a plenty of something else, of which the first was in need.\"\n",
            "\n",
            "Oresme gave the example of a man who: \"had a surplus of sheep and other cattle but needed grain and bread, while the neighbor, on the other hand, had bread enough but lacked cattle … [O]ne region abounded in a thing which another was greatly in need. For this reason, therefore, men began to traffic and exchange their riches with one another, without money, one giving a sheep for some grain, another his labor for bread or wool, and similarly for everything else. And this practice was long the custom in several cities and countries, as Justinus, the historian, and other ancient authors recount.\"\n",
            "\n",
            "The stability of the monetary unit was seen as essential to have just contracts and to avoid moral hazards such as damaging creditors who are paid back with debased coins. Oresme wrote that it is \"disgraceful and everywhere foreign to the nobility of a prince to prohibit the circulation of good money in his country, and, for the sake of gain, to order and even compel his subjects to use his own which is poorer, as if to say that good is bad and his bad is good.\"\n",
            "\n",
            "He was flexible in case of emergencies, such as during periods of war, or to pay ransoms with “bad” or debased money, or to help liberate a kidnapped king. But the bishop added, “If the community should in any way make such an alteration, the money ought to be restored to its proper basis as soon as possible, and the making of gain in that way should cease.”\n",
            "\n",
            "Another late medieval scholar, Copernicus (1473-1543), a Polish luminary more noted for his contributions to astronomy than to economics and moral philosophy, also wrote about money. Copernicus studied science at the University of Padova and Canon Law at the University of Bologna. He started his book on money by noting:\n",
            "\n",
            "Although there are countless scourges which in general debilitate kingdoms, principalities, and republics, the four most important (in my judgment) are dissension, [abnormal] mortality, barren soil, and debasement of the currency. The first three are so obvious that nobody is unaware of their existence. But the fourth, which concerns money, is taken into account by few persons and only the most perspicacious. For it undermines states, not by a single attack all at once, but gradually and in a certain covert manner.\n",
            "\n",
            "Most followers of Aquinas had similar views on money. Money was developed or “invented” to replace barter and to serve as the most commonly used means of exchange. Its stability was essential for determining justice in contracts. The best book written about monetary economics before Adam Smith was the Treatise on Money, written by the Jesuit Juan de Mariana (1536-1624). He compared the transfer of wealth through currency debasement to the action of someone who goes into private barns and steals a portion of the crops stored there: \"The king has no domain over the goods of the people, and he cannot take them in whole or in part. We can see then: would it be licit for the king to go into a private barn taking for himself half of the wheat and trying to satisfy the owner by saying that he can sell the rest at twice the price? I do not think we can find a person with such depraved judgment as to approve this, yet the same is done with copper coins.\"\n",
            "\n",
            "What would Aquinas say about Bitcoin?\n",
            "\n",
            "St. Thomas Aquinas, following Aristotle, was suspicious of exchanges of money for money because they were “not concerned with the needs for life but with making money.” Whenever they address money, he and his followers focus on its stability, condemning its debasement, and on the justice of the contracts established in money. The knowledge of parties and the willingness to assume risks are also relevant. Metallic money had existed for at least 17 centuries, so moralists had enough knowledge to judge. Cryptocurrencies, on the other hand, are so new, and the issues so diverse, that I only have room to summarize what I think Aquinas’s answer would be, and leave for a future article a more elaborate “Thomistic” analysis. And I will do it in two words: Aquinas would not have condemned Bitcoin but would have said, “Buyer beware”—caveat emptor!\n",

            "Consistently making the right decision in situations like this is, I believe, more important than getting the timing right on the initial purchase. Think about it: how often do you bottom-tick a stock and it never trades below your purchase price? Answer: ALMOST NEVER!

So I pitched it again, this time on an even bigger stage at the Robin Hood Investors Conference on 10/21/14 – and again looked look a total idiot as the company continued to struggle and the stock continued to tumble, falling below $14 less than a year later – and staying depressed into April 2016.

            "July was a solid month for cryptocurrencies overall, with the price of Bitcoin reversing the steady declines seen over the previous two months to hover around $8,200 around the end of the month. This marked a strong recovery from the low of $5,755 seen in late June, but was still well below the all-time high of almost $20,000 last December, and also a good 18% lower than the ~$10,000 figure seen less than three months ago.\n",

Given the current weakness in Bitcoin trading activity, we have reduced our forecast for number of unique users as well as transaction volumes in our interactive Bitcoin Price Estimator. We now expect the Bitcoin price to settle around $9,500 by the end of the year for our base case scenario – down from our earlier estimate of $10,500.

            "\n",
            "The global cryptocurrency industry has seen a flurry of new developments since December. Many of these developments had a negative impact on the growth prospects of cryptocurrencies, such as restrictions by banks on the use of credit cards to buy cryptocurrencies, and calls by financial regulators across the world for caution while investing in digital currencies (with some countries even banning their use). This sent cryptocurrencies sliding in value from the all-time highs seen in mid-December 2017, as demonstrated by the slump in Bitcoin’s price from almost $20,000 then to below $6,000 in early February.\n",
            "\n",
            "However, Bitcoin prices saw a sharp recovery over April and early May, primarily because the traditional financial industry began warming up to cryptocurrencies. While Goldman Sachs became the first investment bank to start a cryptocurrency trading desk, IntercontinentalExchange (which owns the NYSE) reported its ongoing work on a new trading platform that will allow institutional investors to buy and hold cryptocurrencies. As this points to increased adoption of cryptocurrencies in the near term, the good news propelled Bitcoin prices higher.\n",
            "\n",
            "But Bitcoin prices slumped in late May when Mt. Gox dumped more than 8,200 Bitcoins on existing exchanges, and further in June when two South Korean cryptocurrency exchanges were hacked. In addition to having a negative impact on Bitcoin pricing, these events also dragged down Bitcoin trading activity, as evidenced by a notable reduction in the number of users on the Bitcoin network. The trend reversed in July, though, with renewed institutional interest in cryptocurrencies driving activity levels. This was driven by growing optimism around the SEC potentially approving a Bitcoin ETF.\n",
            "\n",
            "The SEC’s approval would make Bitcoin a more accessible investment option for investors globally, and definitely presents a sizable upside for the cryptocurrency. However, little has been able to quell investor concerns about the security of cryptocurrency exchanges over recent months – something that we believe will continue to weigh on activity levels in the near future.\n",

            "\n",
            "Like the price for anything, Bitcoin’s fundamental price depends primarily on demand and supply. Demand for Bitcoin is primarily driven by two factors: the number of active users, and how much they transact. On the supply side, the number of available Bitcoins is capped, and about 80% of the capped number is already mined. As such, it is sensible to focus on the demand, both in terms of users and transaction volumes. In our interactive Bitcoin Price Estimator, we forecast changes in the number of unique users as well as transaction volumes for each month over the rest of 2018 to arrive at our estimate for Bitcoin’s fundamental value.\n",
            "\n",
            "As we detailed above, given the headwinds faced by both of these metrics over the month of August, we expect them to grow at a modest pace over coming months. As a result, we believe that the Bitcoin will very likely remain below $10,000 for the rest of the year.\n",

            "\n",
            "Since Bitcoin is still early in the process of monetization, it is largely owned by miners, wealthy investors, and highly technical people. Mining is not a realistic option, as most people don’t have high-end computers to verify blockchain transactions. So most people have bought bitcoin through an exchange, and held onto it as an investment (also known as HODLing). Setting up an account with an exchange to invest in bitcoin isn’t easy either — a person must complete a multi-day or even multi-week process of verifying identity, going through an extensive background check, linking a bank account, and ultimately investing their hard-earned money in a volatile asset. While investing has historically been the “easiest” way to get bitcoin, it’s still not that easy. And with increasing regulations and compliance, it’s not getting easier anytime soon.\n",
            "\n",

            "We realized the solution was actually quite simple: distribute bitcoin through online shopping, an activity that millions of people do every day. All you have to do is download Lolli and shop as you normally would. Our brand partners pay us to drive sales to their sites. When you shop on one of our partners’ sites — like Jet, Bloomingdale’s, Hotwire, or SeatGeek — we get commission for driving the sale. We then split that commission with you, sending bitcoin to your Lolli wallet. Everyone wins.\n",
            "\n",

One thing we’re not able to seamlessly share is money. Sending payments should be as simple as sending a text message. But today, if you need to send money across borders to friends and family, pay business partners, or buy something from an online retailer, you deal with the burden of fees and intermediaries.\n",

            "The Lolli team believes in bitcoin as a universal store of value — and in an increasingly digital age, we think it has the potential to be the global currency of the future. Bitcoin has many important and unique use cases. It can power microtransactions. It can fund microfinance initiatives. It can help people in volatile economies store their money, free from government confiscation or hyperinflation — like people are currently doing in Venezuela. And of course, bitcoin has been a way for people around the world to invest their money. Down the line, we believe bitcoin will be critical for the billions of unbanked people around the world.\n",
            "\n",
            "So what’s stopping everyone from owning and using bitcoin? Put simply: it’s inaccessible. Over 60% of Americans have heard of bitcoin, but very few actually own any. Some studies show that over 70% of bitcoin owners are male, and the majority of them are between 18 and 34 years old. In one survey about bitcoin, 35% of respondents said it was too risky, 27% found it too difficult to understand, 18% said it’s a scam, 16% were waiting for the bubble to burst, 11% found it too difficult to use, and 6% thought there are too many fees. Lolli solves for all of that. It de-risks bitcoin, educates people about crypto, provides a real use case, simplifies earning, and eliminates fees.\n",

            "With the margin trading system of BitMEX, traders can record major gains by either trading against or for Bitcoin, increasing their profits with the leverage they use.

            "“On Wednesday, August 22 at 01:00 UTC, BitMEX will be performing maintenance to improve engine performance. This will require migrating the physical machine that trading operations execute upon, which will require temporarily taking down trading. Trading will suspend at 01:00 UTC and the site will enter maintenance mode shortly thereafter. We expect this maintenance to take 30 minutes and will update our users via Twitter throughout.”\n",

            "Bitcoin has had tremendous success as a cryptocurrency, with millions of people around the world having traded the currency through command lines and wallets like Coinbase. Yet, for all of the excitement in the space, BTC remains largely the province of technically-sophisticated finance and software junkies and their Uber drivers. How can everyone in the world use crypto?\n",
            "\n",
            "For Alex Adelman, that challenge proved an enigma. Partnering with Matt Senter, he had previously founded Cosmic Cart, a “universal shopping cart” that would allow companies to sell their goods anywhere online. The company was eventually acquired by POPSUGAR, and acquired a second time by Ebates, a Rakuten-owned affiliate marketing platform. Adelman wanted to get into the blockchain world, but didn’t want to leave behind his network in the retail world.\n",
            "\n",
            "After reconnecting and exploring, Adelman and Senter realized that scaling consumer demand for Bitcoin is the critical challenge for widespread adoption of the technology, and that retail rewards and loyalty could represent a port of entry for consumers new to cryptocurrencies.\n",
            "\n",
            "Out of that thinking was born Lolli. Lolli is a rewards platform that offers users BTC when they shop at participating online retailers. Consumers install a browser extension or start from Lolli’s website to discover retailers offering crypto rewards (smartphone and tablet apps are “coming soon”). Each retailer sets their own “cashback” (cryptoback?) rate, and that BTC reward is then moved into a Lolli wallet.\n",
            "\n",
            "The company’s name is inspired by the lollipops that Adelman received as a kid when visiting his bank. The dream is to massively expand the number of consumers who have Bitcoin wallets, while also educating them on what cryptocurrency is and how to use it.\n",
            "\n",
            "What makes Lolli compelling though isn’t the concept — loyalty in the crypto space isn’t particularly unknown nor are airdrops — but rather the deep bench of online retailers that are included right from the startup’s launch. Adelman told me that users can already shop at more than 500 retailers, including Jet, Forever21, Bloomingdales, and ClassPass, avoiding the chicken and egg problem endemic to many rewards startups.\n",
            "\n",
            "As with all rewards and loyalty programs, there is a two-sided marketplace component that can make these challenging to scale. One interesting dynamic though is that retailers are increasingly looking for ways to engage with cryptocurrencies. Adelman explained to me that the retailers he has been talking to have been surprised at the wide excitement among consumers around crypto and what it means, and they want to use that excitement to engage with potential new customers.\n",
            "\n",
            "While many retailers have flitted back and forth about whether to accept Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as a valid payment method, there is less concern on the rewards side about the volatility of cryptocurrencies. Plus, connecting with consumers around the technology can give retailers an early look into how consumers think about their wallets, and how they might change their online shopping behaviors in the future.\n",
            "\n",
            "In many ways, Lolli is symmetrical to another recently launched loyalty app called Bumped. Bumped partners with retailers to drive loyalty, but instead of handing out BTC, it hands out free shares (or microshares) of the stock of the company a consumer just shopped at. The idea there, as with Lolli, is that few consumers own stock these days, and rewards and loyalty can be a mechanism to drive shopping behavior while also providing an initial financial portfolio for consumers.\n",
            "\n",
            "While gross transaction volume and user engagement are valuable themselves, what really drives the valuations of these companies is the wallet or brokerage accounts behind them. Investors highly value these sorts of gateway financial products, which is one reason why Robinhood is valued at $5.6 billion with just more than 4 million accounts. Lolli’s bet is that it can become the de facto wallet for millions of consumers.\n",
            "\n",
            "Lolli only supports Bitcoin at launch, and Adelman is certainly a strong proponent of the view that Bitcoin is likely the one cryptocurrency to rule them all. With many more consumers potentially getting their first satoshis though, Lollis’ dream, and the dream of many crypto investors, may well have a chance to come to pass.\n",
            "Bitmain, the China-based cryptocurrency mining behemoth, has acquired the status of a legend in the industry, with a ton of mystery surrounding its operations. The company is undoubtedly one of the most profitable cryptocurrency businesses in the world. But it seems, Bitmain is now slowly falling out of favor.\n",
            "\n",
            "A report from investment research firm Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. suggests that Bitmain is losing its technological advantage over its competitors in producing the cryptocurrency mining chips. As per the analysts, while Bitmain still controls as much as 85 percent of the cryptocurrency mining equipment market, other companies such as Canaan Inc. and Ebang International Holdings Inc. are catching up.\n",
            "\n",
            "“The Beijing-based company, co-founded by 32-year-old billionaire Jihan Wu, may need to write down the value of its inventory as makers of rival mining gear catch up,” the analysts said in the report. “Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., which produces chips designed by Bitmain, should ask the company to make full prepayments and refrain from adding capacity solely for [cryptocurrency] related demand.”\n",
            "\n",
            "It is worth noting that Bitmain makes majority of its profits from selling the mining equipment. The other minor sources of its revenue include mining cryptocurrency itself, the management fees it charges from its mining pools, and renting out mining power through cloud services.\n",
            "\n",
            "However, if the Bernstein report’s claims are true, it would explain why Bitmain has been taking some drastic steps lately. Bitmain first struck controversy in March this year, when it sold its $12,000 mining equipment for Monero (XRM) and other privacy-oriented coins — knowing fully-well that the equipment will become obsolete by the time it actually ships.\n",
            "\n",
            "Over the past year, Bitmain’s focus seems to have shifted from primarily focussing on selling the mining equipment to a more diversified portfolio. It has taken a particular interest in mining cryptocurrencies itself as well. The company announced a $500 million cryptocurrency mining farm in Texas earlier this month.\n",
            "\n",
            "Bitmain has also invested heavily in blockchain-platform EOS, cryptocurrency payments company Circle, web-browser Opera, and even incubated a decentralized exchange DEx.top. In fact, according to the company’s CEO Jihan Wu, up to 40 percent of Bitmain’s profit over the next five years could be coming from selling AI chips instead of cryptocurrency mining equipment.\n",
            "\n",
            "Considering that Bitmain was sternly focused on making mining equipment until very recently, it is certainly surprising that it is aiming for such diversity in a short span of time. Bitmain’s initial public offering (IPO) has also raised some concerns about its financial standing.\n",
            "\n",
            "The much-anticipated IPO is expected to reach around $18 billion and investors seem to be taking notice. Reports surfaced earlier this month that Softbank Group and Tencent have participated in Bitmain’s pre-IPO. However, both companies have now denied any involvement with the IPO, raising doubt over the expected number of $18 billion for Bitmain’s IPO.\n",
            "\n",
            "Bitmain’s financial liquidity was further challenged when its pre-IPO investment documents showed that the company holds a significant portion of its money in Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Bitcoin (BTC)’s controversial hard fork.\n",
            "\n",
            "According to the Bitmain pre-IPO investor deck, they sold most of their #Bitcoin for #Bcash. At $900/BCH, they've bled half a billion in the last 3 months. If Bitcoin Core devs didn't disclose the Bcash vulnerability, it could've wiped a billion dollars off their balance sheets. pic.twitter.com/9BMywdvvby — Samson Mow (@Excellion) August 11, 2018\n",
            "\n",
            "Blockstream’s Chief Strategy Officer (CSO) Samson Mow points out that Bitmain bought the BCH at the price of of $900/BCH. If it now attempts to sell the BCH that it holds, that would significantly bring down the price of the cryptocurrency. Therefore, Bitmain’s investment isn’t exactly liquid.\n",
            "\n",
            "Bitmain’s announcement of the IPO did come as a surprise, and has been surrounded in controversies. It seems likely that, as the Bernstein report shows, Bitmain is losing its monstrous control over the cryptocurrency mining business, forcing it to venture to other businesses.\n",

More recently, cryptocurrencies have been surging as some argue the bloodletting is behind the digital token market. Chris Yoo, portfolio manager at crypto-only investment firm Black Square Capital, recently told MarketWatch he thinks the cryptocurrency market is near the end of the bearish sentiment. “Most importantly, the ecosystem will continue to develop and grow from the increase in talent and public awareness, leading to the recovery of the market in the near future,” he said.\n",

            "\n",
            "There is a key difference, though. Magic's cards are pieces of paper, meaning players have to be physically present and requiring them to lug heavy, valuable cards around. Hearthstone's cards are digital, but the game is centralized.\n",
            "\n",
            "In centralized games, Ferguson said, players \"have so little security over what they're given in game. Essentially it's just a license to use a certain costume or a certain item on a server, and the game's company can alter stats as they wish and do whatever they think is best.\"\n",
            "\n",
            "In Gods Unchained, by contrast, the cards are non-fungible ERC-721 tokens housed on the ethereum blockchain. That means they are fully owned and controlled by the holder of an account's cryptographic key, with no risk that they will be altered or taken away. (There will, however, be a short \"rebalancing period\" after launch, during which Fuel Games can alter cards to make sure none are too powerful).\n",

            "Gaming \"is taking up so much of people's lives and identity nowadays,\" he said, \"people are even using it as their jobs.\" Professionals can't risk their cards being weakened (\"nerfed\").\n",

            "\n",
            "Launch ahead, the \"main goal\" now according to Ferguson, is to attract 100,000 or a million players to \"Gods Unchained\" and, by extension to ethereum and the crypto asset ecosystem. \"We want to offer them the chance to seamlessly […] get their first $5 or $10 worth of crypto through buying the cards,\" he said.\n",
            "\n",

            "Gods Unchained might be putting those doubts to bed. Fuel Games has sold over 4,600 ether worth of cards for the game, worth around $1.3 million at the time of writing. But while the Hyperion card's $60,000 price tag is impressive in the context of trading card games, it's a far cry from CryptoKitties' record: one cat traded hands for $111,000 in December.\n",
            "\n",
            "Down the line, some investors believe that NFTs enable use cases far more valuable and consequential than gaming: real estate, precious metals and other assets could be tokenized, enabling investors to buy smaller, more liquid stakes in these assets.\n",

            "After being found guilty of hacking internal computer systems at Electronic Arts, which saw him gain access to over 25,000 customer records and steal in-game items which totaled over $320,000 in value, Marisch was ordered to pay bail to the value of $750,000 in cryptocurrency.\n",

            "Even if the wallet had been appropriately setup, the FBI stated they would be unable to receive the funds due to “liability issues.” These issues include holding such a vast sum of cryptocurrency that could fluctuate dramatically in value, making the bail payment too volatile to hold as a bond.\n",
            "\n",
            "As a solution to these issues, the court backpedaled on their initial order of paying the bail payment entirely in cryptocurrency and demanded that Marisch convert his tokens into $750,000 fiat.\n",

            "Only, this created more headaches for the legal system. Marisch holds various lesser-known cryptocurrencies that are not traded on the same level as the likes of Bitcoin or Ethereum; liquidating $750,000 worth into cash could have caused dramatic and adverse effects on the market (the cryptocurrency that Marisch holds has not been disclosed).\n",

            "\n",
            "The world is full of connected devices — and more are coming. In 2017, there were an estimated 8.4 billion internet-enabled thermostats, cameras, streetlights, and other electronics. By 2020 that number could exceed 20 billion, and by 2030 there could be 500 billion or more. Because they’ll all be online all the time, each of those devices — whether a voice-recognition personal assistant or a pay-by-phone parking meter or a temperature sensor deep in an industrial robot — will be vulnerable to a cyberattack and could even be part of one.\n",
            "\n",
            "Today, many “smart” internet-connected devices are made by large companies with well-known brand names, like Google, Apple, Microsoft, and Samsung, which have both the technological systems and the marketing incentive to fix any security problems quickly. But that’s not the case in the increasingly crowded world of smaller internet-enabled devices, like light bulbs, doorbells, and even packages shipped by UPS. Those devices, and their digital “brains,” are typically made by unknown companies, many in developing countries, without the funds or ability — or the brand-recognition need — to incorporate strong security features.\n",
            "\n",
            "Insecure “internet of things” devices have already contributed to major cyber-disasters, such as the October 2016 cyber attack on internet routing company Dyn that took down more than 80 popular websites and stalled internet traffic across the US. The solution to this problem, in my view as a scholar of “internet of things” technology, blockchain systems and cybersecurity, could be a new way of tracking and distributing security software updates using blockchains.\n",

            "Making Security a Priority\n",
            "\n",
            "Today’s big technology companies work hard to keep users safe, but they have set themselves a daunting task: Thousands of complex software packages running on systems all over the world will invariably have errors that make them vulnerable to hackers. They also have teams of researchers and security analysts who try to identify and fix flaws before they cause problems.\n",
            "\n",
            "When those teams find out about vulnerabilities (whether from their own or others’ work, or from users’ reports of malicious activity), they are well positioned to program updates, and to send them out to users. These companies’ computers, phones, and even many software programs connect periodically to their manufacturers’ sites to check for updates, and can download and even install them automatically.\n",
            "\n",
            "Beyond the staffing needed to track problems and create fixes, that effort requires enormous investment. It requires software to respond to the automated inquiries, storage space for new versions of software, and network bandwidth to send it all out to millions of users quickly. That’s how people’s iPhones, PlayStations, and copies of Microsoft Word all stay fairly seamlessly up to date with security fixes.\n",
            "\n",
            "None of that is happening with the manufacturers of the next generation of internet devices. Take, for example, Hangzhou Xiongmai Technology, based near Shanghai, China. Xiongmai makes internet-connected cameras and accessories under its brand and sells parts to other vendors.\n",
            "\n",
            "Many of its products — and those of many other similar companies — contained administrative passwords that were set in the factory and were difficult or impossible to change. That left the door open for hackers to connect to Xiongmai-made devices, enter the preset password, take control of webcams or other devices, and generate enormous amounts of malicious internet traffic.\n",
            "\n",
            "When the problem — and its global scope — became clear, there was little Xiongmai and other manufacturers could do to update their devices. The ability to prevent future cyber attacks like that depends on creating a way these companies can quickly, easily, and cheaply issue software updates to customers when flaws are discovered.\n",

            "\n",
            "I’m not the only person suggesting using blockchain systems to improve internet-connected devices’ security. In January 2017, a group including US networking giant Cisco, German engineering firm Bosch, Bank of New York Mellon, Chinese electronics maker Foxconn, Dutch cybersecurity company Gemalto, and a number of blockchain startup companies formed to develop just such a system.\n",
            "\n",
            "It would be available for device makers to use in place of creating their own software update infrastructure the way the tech giants have. These smaller companies would have to program their products to check in with a blockchain system periodically to see if there was new software. Then they would securely upload their updates as they developed them. Each device would have a strong cryptographic identity, to ensure the manufacturer is communicating with the right device. As a result, device makers and their customers would know the equipment would efficiently keep its security up to date.\n",
            "\n",
            "These sorts of systems would have to be easy to program into small devices with limited memory space and processing power. They would need standard ways to communicate and authenticate updates, to tell official messages from hackers’ efforts. Existing blockchains, including Bitcoin SPV and Ethereum Light Client Protocol, look promising. And blockchain innovators will continue to find better ways, making it even easier for billions of “internet of things” devices to check in and update their security automatically.\n",

            "\n",
            "In a move that may do much to validate Gartner's finding this week that blockchain hype cycle is entering the so-called \"trough of disillusionment,\" Patten admitted he rarely brings up the technology, choosing instead to focus on the cost savings Cobalt can bring without the benefit of some of the most popular buzzwords of the last few years.\n",
