My view is that cybercrime is more of a threat to this country than drugs. This is not a problem that policing can solve. We cannot investigate our way out of this issue; we have to look at it in a different way.” Again and again, the police had started to say that it couldn’t just be them that took responsibility for law and order in the online world.\n",

            "“Unlike the common ransomware, systematically distributed via massive spam campaigns and exploit kits, Ryuk is used exclusively for tailored attacks,” Check Point researchers said in a post on the code, today. “In fact, its encryption scheme is intentionally built for small-scale operations, such that only crucial assets and resources are infected in each targeted network with its infection and distribution carried out manually by the attackers.”\n",
            "\n",
            "Researchers said that the attackers are asking for varied sums in return for file decryption, depending on the target — ranging from 15 BTC to 50 BTC (roughly $96,000 to $320,000).\n",

            "“Some organizations paid an exceptionally large ransom,” they noted.\n",

A second note is for the less lucrative victims, featuring a blunter note.\n",

            "\n",
            "However, attribution is somewhat difficult, especially given that while tracking the money trail, researchers saw that Ryuk’s authors are disguising their received payments by dividing and transferring them among multiple wallets. After a ransom payment is made to a preassigned wallet, some 25 percent of the funds are transferred to a new wallet. The remaining amount is also transferred to a new wallet; however, the remaining funds are split and relocated again.\n",

            "“Ryuk ransomware has not been widely distributed… it has only been used in targeted attacks, which makes it a lot harder to track the malware author’s activities and revenues,” Check Point analysts said. “Almost each malware sample was provided a unique wallet and shortly after the ransom payment was made, the funds were divided and transmitted through multiple other accounts.”\n",

            "Connections to Hermes\n",
            "\n",
            "While the operation is sophisticated, the ransomware’s technical capabilities are relatively low, Check Point found. However, its code has notable similarities to the Hermes ransomware, a malware commonly attributed to the Lazarus Group. Hermes first gained publicity in October 2017 when it was used as part of a sophisticated SWIFT attack against the Far Eastern International Bank (FEIB) in Taiwan.\n",
            "\n",

            "\n",
            "“Indeed, if we compare the function that encrypts a single file, we see much similarity in its structure,” according to Check Point. “In fact, it seems that the author of Ryuk did not even bother to change the marker in the encrypted files as the code used to generate, place and verify this marker in order to determine if a file was already encrypted are identical in both malwares.”\n",
            "\n",
            "Also, the firm noted that both whitelist similar folders (e.g. “Ahnlab,” “Microsoft,” “Chrome” “Mozilla,” “$Recycle.Bin” etc.); both write a batch script named “window.bat” in the same path; and in both cases there are files dropped to disk (“PUBLIC” and “UNIQUE_ID_DO_NOT_REMOVE”) that are similar in name and purpose.\n",
            "\n",
            "“This leads us to believe that the current wave of targeted attacks using Ryuk may either be the work of the Hermes operators, the allegedly North Korean group, or the work of an actor who has obtained the Hermes source code,” researchers noted.\n",
            "\n",
            "Also, as regards the whitelisted files, the ransomware performs a standard recursive sweep of every drive and network share on the victim system, and encrypts every file and directory except for those containing text from the hardcoded whitelist.\n",
            "\n",
            "“It’s clear why the attackers would want the victim’s web browser intact given that it may be required for reading the ransom note, purchasing cryptocurrency and so on,” researchers noted. “But it is less clear why the attackers are concerned with encrypting the victim’s copy of a South Korean endpoint protection product, especially given that this attack wasn’t even targeted at South Korean users.”\n",
            "\n",
            "It does make sense, however, if the Hermes ransomware is being re-used and rebranded as “Ryuk” ransomware.\n",
            "\n",
            "Further, when it comes to the trust model, the original Hermes actually generated the tier-two per-victim RSA keypairs, as opposed to embedding hard-coded copies in the malware samples; however, “the encryption function itself, including the encrypted file format and its associated unique ‘Hermes’ file magic, are reproduced wholesale in the rebranded version.”\n",

Since July, cybersecurity researchers, journalists and victims, have seen a spike in extortion letters and emails demanding hefty sums of bitcoin. The twist is that the scammers send the victim one of their own passwords, likely gleaned from an already public breach, and use that as an intimidation tactic. The blackmailers then claim they have hacked into the target’s webcam while they were watching pornography. Pay up, or they’ll release the (made-up) video.\n",

It’s you doing nasty things!),” the version Krebs published adds, before demanding the victim sends $1,400 in bitcoin to a specific bitcoin address.\n",

            "It’s an enticing, if not devilish, proposition. Banbreach looked at around 770 wallets in total, according to a spreadsheet the company shared with Motherboard.

            "This figure is also likely only a conservative estimate, considering Banbreach’s methodology would not have captured all, or perhaps even the majority, of sextortion emails.

The keynote was presented by Khaled Khorshid, Co-Founder | Technology and Hesham El Metainy Co-Founder | Strategy & Commercial for Treon and described their goal of realizing the true value of blockchain technology where it is most needed - in emerging economies throughout the world and in making utilities payments easy and secure even for the world's 1.7 billion unbanked mobile users.\n",

In emerging economies, blockchain startups like Treon truly can change and improve lives.\"\n",

What seems commonplace in some countries will be a life-changing shift in paradigm throughout parts of Africa and Asia and throughout the world.\"\n",

The Treon Token is a definite solution for the unbanked that constitutes a considerable percentage of 76% of the total number of mobile users globally. From now on, they will join the rest of society and have access to the same digital system to pay their utility bills.\n",

            "Though there are attempts of higher highs now that most coins are yet to break away from key support lines and still trading inside that strong bullish engulfing candlestick of Aug 17, odds are today sellers might snap back and confirm the eight month bear trend. As seen from the chart, Litecoin, Tron, Stellar and even IOTA registered losses with EOS printing a seven percent loss yesterday.\n",

            "EOS Technical Analysis\n",
            "\n",
            "It’s back to red territory for EOS. Accompanying this depreciation is a seven percent drop in the last day effectively nullifying last week’s attempts for higher highs. Judging from the chart, our EOS trade plan is clear: Sell on every high going forward now that yesterday’s price action was limited with sellers failing to breach Aug 20 lows.\n",
            "\n",
            "Considering the general layout of candlestick in the last 20 days or so, our bear break out pattern which went live after Aug 8 high volume break below $7 confirming June 22 break below $9—the upper limit of our last consolidation is now live.\n",
            "\n",
            "As such, and as per our iteration in our last EOS technical analysis, fading the trend by buying is counter intuitive especially if we bring into the picture the strong bear trend of the last eight months.\n",
            "\n",
            "Litecoin (LTC) Technical Analysis\n",
            "\n",
            "From the chart, LTC prices are confined within a $15 trade range defined by our immediate resistance at Aug 17 highs at $65 and lows at $50 as marked by the lows of Aug 14 pin bar.\n",
            "\n",
            "While we retain a bearish projection, buyers might build up momentum and break above $70 cancelling our sell stance.\n",
            "\n",
            "If not and there is a dip below $50, then we recommend shorting on pull backs in lower time frames with stops at the break out highs with first targets at $30 as laid out in our last LTC trade plan.\n",
            "\n",
            "Stellar Lumens (XLM) Technical Analysis\n",
            "\n",
            "Of all the coins under our review, Stellar Lumens looks promising. Not only did it recovery and rebuff sell pressure once Facebook launching rumors began doing rounds but the simple fact is that XLM is steady and is actually one of the top performer in the last month or so.\n",
            "\n",
            "For now, Stellar Lumens sellers appear to have an upper hand following yesterday’s six percent drop and since the overall trend is bearish, odds are we might see further depreciation today more so after prices dip below our minor one week support trend line as marked in the chart.\n",
            "\n",
            "Once that happen, we shall recommend risk off traders to sell on every high in lower time frames with stops above the break out candlestick and first targets at 15 cents and later 8 cents. On the flip side, conservatives can take a neutral stand and trade according to our laid out Stellar Lumens trade plan only initiating trades once XLM bulls edge prices above 26 cents on the upside and 18 cents on the downside.\n",

            "\n",
            "Like most coins, not only are TRX prices moving within tight ranges but yesterday’s price action failed to breach below or above Aug 20 high low.\n",
            "\n",
            "In that case, our previous Tron (TRX) is solid and going forward, short term aggressive traders would be free to initiate shorts only when there is conclusive high volume close below 1.8 cents as they sync with the general trend with first targets at Jan 24 lows.\n",
            "\n",
            "If not and say buyers build up enough momentum confirming Aug 17 Morning Star bullish reversal pattern and edging past 2.2 cents, then we recommend low size longs with first targets at 3 cents as the retest phase is completed.\n",

            "IOTA (IOT) Technical Analysis\n",
            "\n",
            "If anything, yesterday was the fourth day of yet another lower time frame consolidation inside Aug 17 high low. This not only validates our previous trade plans but builds up momentum of a potential break above or below 60 cents or 45 cents.\n",
            "\n",
            "Though altcoins sentiment has been bright in recent days, chances are we might see lower lows and snap back to trend more so if there is a break below 45 cents today or in coming days.\n",

            "It's been a few months now—since Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies peaked earlier this year—that graphics cards have been hard to come by. If they're scarce again soon, it won't be due to mining, but rather demand for Nvidia's brand new RTX 2000 series cards. Recent news has reflected just how far cryptocurrencies have fallen since their peak, and what the cost of that has been for many investors. As The Motley Fool lays out, the biggest currencies have lost as much as 93 percent of their peak value compared to earlier this year.\n",
            "\n",
            "Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency, has fared the best: it's down 68 percent from its peak at around $20,000 in December. As of today, Bitcoin's value is close to $6500, which is still higher than where it was in August 2017: under $5000. Other popular coins, including Ethereum and Ripple, have fared worse, down 80 percent and 92 percent, respectively.\n",

            "On Monday The New York Times also reported on the sharp cryptocurrency fall since coins hit their peak values, focusing less on specific numbers and more on the people affected. Many of those caught up in the crypto fever of late 2017, who invested as coins came close to their peaks, have taken painful losses. The story includes quotes from people who have, like some of the cryptocurrencies themselves, now lost 90 percent of their money.\n",

            "\"By many metrics, more people put money into virtual currencies last fall and winter than in all of the preceding nine or so years...\" writes The Times. \"Almost all of the new customers on Coinbase and Square would be in the red if they bought cryptocurrencies at almost any point over the last nine months and held on to them... The value of all outstanding digital tokens has fallen by about $600 billion, or 75 percent, since the peak in January, according to data from the website coinmarketcap.com.\"\n",
