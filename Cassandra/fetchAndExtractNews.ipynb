      "['', u'The world\\u2019s largest graphic card and chip maker Nvidia has officially put an end to its crypto venture, with the official announcement of its CFO Colette Kress.\\n\\nJensen Huang, the CEO at Nvidia, echoed the negative sentiment of Kress, adding that the profitability of its cryptocurrency-focused mining chips has declined substantially, as the price of cryptocurrencies moved to a downward trend.\\n\\nIn July, CCN reported that Bitmain, the biggest conglomerate in the cryptocurrency sector valued at $19 billion, recorded a profit of $1.1 billion in the first quarter of 2018, generating approximately 65 times the profit recorded by Nvidia\\u2019s cryptocurrency venture.\\n\\nInterestingly, Bitmain recorded a profit of $1.1 billion in the first three months of 2018, while Nvidia generated a profit of $550 million, exactly 50 percent of Bitmain\\u2019s. Despite being the biggest graphic card and chip manufacturer in the global market, Nvidia was not able to surpass the profitability of Bitmain.\\n\\nHence, the argument that Nvidia\\u2019s cryptocurrency venture is struggling due to the downtrend in the crypto market is inaccurate, primarily because Bitmain, which essentially conducts a similar operation as Nvidia\\u2019s cryptocurrency arm, recorded a larger profit than all of the operations of Nvidia combined.\\n\\nAlso, while the prices of major cryptocurrencies have fallen significantly by more than 70 percent on average, the hash rate of Bitcoin and other proof-of-work (PoW) blockchain networks has increased substantially in the past eight months, demonstrating stable growth.\\n\\nSimply put, given that the demand for cryptocurrency mining is at an all-time high and mining equipment manufacturers like Bitmain, Canaan, and Samsung are seeing rapid progress in their growth, the declining performance of Nvidia\\u2019s cryptocurrency venture cannot be attributed to the general trend of the crypto market.\\n\\nThe core problem with Nvidia\\u2019s cryptocurrency arm is that the demand for GPU mining has declined. There is only a handful of tokens and cryptocurrencies which miners can produce with GPU miners, because of the lack of computing power in the chips used to create graphic cards.\\n\\nASIC mining chips or mining equipment that are developed specifically to mine cryptocurrencies, are being improved at an exponential rate by the key players in the cryptocurrency mining sector, and as such, it is difficult for miners to rely on graphic cards and chips that are not designed to mine crypto to produce digital assets.\\n\\nConclusively, the profitability of Nvidia\\u2019s cryptocurrency venture was not affected by the decline in the demand for cryptocurrency mining and digital assets in general, but rather the decline in interest towards GPU miners and graphic cards for mining cryptocurrencies, due to their inefficiency in comparison to ASIC miners.', u\"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - US Representative Duncan Hunter, a Republican from California, was indicted on charges that he and his wife used campaign funds to pay for personal expenses and filed false campaign finance reports, federal officials said on Tuesday.\\n\\nHunter, who was first elected to the US House of Representatives in 2008, has been accused of conspiracy, wire fraud, falsification of records and other charges, said Adam Braverman, US Attorney for the Southern District of California.\\n\\nBraverman, in a prepared statement, said a federal grand jury indicted the lawmaker and his wife for misusing more than $250,000 in campaign funds to pay for family vacations, groceries, video games, meals and other personal expenses.\\n\\nAides to Hunter did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\\n\\nThe 41-year-old congressman from San Diego was one of the first Republicans in Washington in early 2016 to endorse Donald Trump's presidential bid.\\n\\nAnother early backer of Trump, Republican Representative Chris Collins of New York, ended his bid for re-election earlier this month after he was charged with participating in an insider trading scheme.\", u'A drive-by deal is a slang term referring to a deal in which a venture capitalist (VC) invests in a startup with the goal of a very quick exit strategy. The venture capitalist takes little to no active role in the management and monitoring of the startup, but instead seeks to increase the size of his investment by quickly finding a suitor to acquire the new venture, or else to speed it through to an initial public offering (IPO). A \"drive-by VC\" is thus a venture capitalist who engages in this type of deal.\\n\\nCritics say a drive-by deal results in companies which are pushed towards an IPO even though they are not objectively ready - and all because the VC wants to get its money out, not necessarily caring if the busines itself (and its founders) ultimately succeeds or fails.\\n\\nA drive-by venture capital deal involves investment in a start-up company where the VC seeks the shortest possible time to exit, ideally by way of an IPO on a stock exchange. Drive-by VC deals may be seen as advantageous for both the start-up company and the venture capital firm, since it allows a company to boost its growth at a very high rate early on in its life cycle and at the same time allows the investors to get back their capital quickly in order to re-invest in new projects without being tied up for years at a atime. However, critics argue that drive-by deals can ultimately lead to unsustainable growth, as the VC firm can pressure the start-up can go public before it is fully prepared. The VC also does not necessarily care about the viability or success of a company or its products & services after the exit has been achieved.\\n\\nThe term \"drive-by\" investing was first coined in the mid 1990s as venture capitalists poured money into technology startups, especially surrounding the dot-com craze. The term refers to the common practice at the time of angel investors and venture capitalists agreeing to fund early stage startup companies without doing any real due diligence to verify if the firm\\u2019s business plan and management team was a worthwhile and promising investment. During the technology boom, VCs were anxious to fund the next big company before their competitors. Drive-by investing occurred because they believed that they didn\\u2019t have enough time to do their due diligence. After the dot-com bubble burst in the early 2000s, this type of quick and dirty VC investing fell out of favor as many investors got burned when the sector collapsed. Still, we have seen a resurgance of this style of investing during the late 2010s as Bitcoin and blockchain-related startups have attracted the interest of VCs who don\\'t want to miss out on the next big thing.', u'A federal judge in Seattle will decide Monday whether to block a Texas-based company from making digital blueprints for\\xa03-D printed firearms publicly available\\xa0online.\\xa0The legal controversy has sparked a national conversation about the implications of\\xa0untraceable plastic guns and constitutional rights.\\n\\nTuesday\\u2019s hearing\\xa0stems from a\\xa0lawsuit filed\\xa0July 30 by eight attorneys general and the District of Columbia against\\xa0the State Department, which had agreed to allow Defense Distributed to publish an arsenal of firearms blueprints online in a planned settlement.\\n\\nThe states\\xa0are arguing that\\xa0the release of\\xa03-D printable designs\\xa0threatens national security\\xa0and abridges states\\u2019 ability to pass and police gun laws. On July 31, Judge Robert S. Lasnik of the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington, citing risks to public safety,\\xa0granted the attorneys general\\u2019s request.\\n\\n\\u201cIf an injunction is not issued and the status quo alters at midnight tonight, the proliferation of these firearms will have many of the negative impacts on a state level that the federal government once feared on the international stage,\\u201d Lasnik said.\\n\\nSince then, 11 other state attorneys general have joined the battle against the State Department. The states requested a permanent injunction from the court, aiming to permanently ban Defense Distributed\\xa0founder Cody Wilson from posting\\xa0the 3-D designs on the Internet.\\n\\nLasnik is expected to make a final decision by Aug. 27; the current order is in place until the following day.\\n\\n\\u201cWe were grateful the court carefully considered our arguments and look forward to the ruling,\\u201d said Joshua Blackman, Wilson\\u2019s attorney.\\n\\nWilson\\u2019s critics say his plan could put unregulated and difficult-to-detect weapons in the wrong hands.\\n\\nThe legal battle over weapon-design files dates back to 2013, when Wilson manufactured the first printed handgun; his design, though plastic, used a metal firing pin. Days after Wilson made the blueprints available online, the federal government demanded that he remove the files. Wilson did, then sued the State Department.\\n\\nAccording to State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert, the Justice Department worked with State throughout the multiyear legal battle. DOJ ultimately recommended settling the suit, predicting a loss in court on First Amendment grounds. In June, the federal government entered into an agreement permitting Wilson to\\xa0publish his firearm blueprints online. He intended to do so Aug. 1.\\n\\nHours before he planned to publish, Lasnik stopped him.\\n\\nTo coincide with the hearing, Wilson launched a \\xa0on Monday. Consumed by four pending lawsuits, he hopes to raise $400,000 in donations\\xa0\\u2014 by credit card, bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash \\u2014 to support his fight. Roger Ver of Bitcoin Cash, who could not be reached for comment, intends to match contributions, according to Wilson.\\n\\n\\u201cDefense Distributed is a defense contractor, only our contracts aren\\u2019t with the state. We contract with the public,\\u201d Wilson told The Washington Post, promising to build a new defense-type application if the public funds the litigation. \\u201cIt\\u2019s a statement of disruption. We can develop things that they don\\u2019t know they\\u2019re mad about yet.\\u201d\\n\\nLast Thursday, the Department of Justice filed a brief\\xa0accusing the 19 attorneys general of misreading the terms of the department\\u2019s settlement with Wilson.\\n\\n\\u201cThis case is not about the regulation of U.S. persons who wish to utilize a 3-D printer to manufacture their own small-caliber firearms. Rather, this case concerns the Department of State\\u2019s delegated authority to control the export of defense articles and services, or technical data related thereto, that raise military or intelligence concerns,\\u201d wrote the department. \\u201cThe domestic harms about which Plaintiffs are allegedly concerned are not properly regulated by the Department under current law.\\u201d\\n\\nThe State Department, which regulates weapons exports, does not have the power to ban dissemination of information to U.S. citizens due to some possibility a person may misuse it, according to court documents.\\n\\n\\u201cPlaintiffs\\u2019 allegations of harm are not reasonably attributable to the Department\\u2019s regulation of exports, but rather focus on the possibility that third parties will commit violations of the Undetectable Firearms Act or other relevant laws that are not at issue in this case,\\u201d\\xa0wrote the department.\\n\\nStill, Attorney General Jeff Sessions has reiterated that it is illegal to manufacture plastic guns that are undetectable.\\n\\n\\u201cWe will not stand for the evasion, especially the flouting, of current law and will take action to ensure that individuals who violate the law by making plastic firearms and rendering them undetectable, will be prosecuted to the fullest extent,\\u201d Sessions said in a statement Thursday.\\n\\nGun-control supporters, such as the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence, have also argued that 3-D printed weapons \\u2014 that avoid layers of federal and state gun-control policies, such as permits and background checks \\u2014 are not\\xa0\\u201ctypically possessed by law-abiding citizens for lawful purposes,\\u201d and, therefore, are not protected under the Second Amendment.\\n\\nOther legal experts have focused on the wide-reaching First Amendment implications of a ruling that bars Wilson from releasing the files. They suggest that prohibiting publication of computer code \\u2014 which has been available for download since at least 2013, according to Nauert \\u2014 amounts to a violation of free-speech rights.\\n\\nFederal judge blocks posting of blueprints for 3-D-printed guns hours before they were to be published\\n\\n\\u2018A little anarchist in Austin\\u2019: 3-D gunmaker pledges to continue fight for homemade guns despite pushback\\n\\nLawmakers are trying to prevent the spread of 3-D-printed guns.

If they\\'re scarce again soon, it won\\'t be due to mining, but rather demand for Nvidia\\'s brand new RTX 2000 series cards. Recent news has reflected just how far cryptocurrencies have fallen since their peak, and what the cost of that has been for many investors. As The Motley Fool lays out, the biggest currencies have lost as much as 93 percent of their peak value compared to earlier this year.\\n\\nBitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency, has fared the best: it\\'s down 68 percent from its peak at around $20,000 in December. As of today, Bitcoin\\'s value is close to $6500, which is still higher than where it was in August 2017: under $5000. Other popular coins, including Ethereum and Ripple, have fared worse, down 80 percent and 92 percent, respectively.\\n\\nOn Monday The New York Times also reported on the sharp cryptocurrency fall since coins hit their peak values, focusing less on specific numbers and more on the people affected. Many of those caught up in the crypto fever of late 2017, who invested as coins came close to their peaks, have taken painful losses. The story includes quotes from people who have, like some of the cryptocurrencies themselves, now lost 90 percent of their money.\\n\\n\"By many metrics, more people put money into virtual currencies last fall and winter than in all of the preceding nine or so years...\" writes The Times. \"Almost all of the new customers on Coinbase and Square would be in the red if they bought cryptocurrencies at almost any point over the last nine months and held on to them... The value of all outstanding digital tokens has fallen by about $600 billion, or 75 percent, since the peak in January, according to data from the website coinmarketcap.com.\"', u\"I think it is fair to say that it has been a reasonably mixed 24 hours of trade for the cryptocurrency market.

Mikhail Goldenkov/Strelka Institute/Flickr\\n\\nTake two women. Both live in New York City.\\n\\nOne is from Arkansas. The other one\\'s from New Hampshire.\\n\\nThey live in the same city \\u2014 but because of the different levels of sexism in their respective birth places, the woman from the south is more likely to face a larger gender pay gap than the woman from the east coast.\\n\\nThat\\'s according to a new study by a group of researchers from the University of Chicago, Northwestern University, and National University of Singapore. First reported by The New York Times, the study reveals how a woman\\'s birth place and where she lives as an adult influence her salary, promotions, and how early she marries or has a baby.\\n\\nOne important note when examining this study: it only studies white men and women. This is, in their words, \"to avoid conflating issues concerning gender with the potentially different set of considerations having to do with race,\" but researchers told the Times that they expect these differences to apply to other demographics.\\n\\nFirst, the research establishes where sexist views around a woman\\'s work prevail the most \\u2014 attitudes like \"women\\'s capacities are inferior to men\" and \"families are hurt when women work.\"\\n\\nLevels of sexism were highest in the Southeast, Utah, and Appalachia and lowest in New England, the West Coast, and the Upper Midwest. In more sexist regions, the authors wrote, \"a girl may grow up within a culture that prizes stay-at-home mothers over working moms, as well as early marriages and large families.\"\\n\\nThen, the study suggests how sexism in one\\'s birthplace or adult home influenced how men and women act.\\n\\n\"Sexism affects women through two channels: one is their own preferences that are shaped by where they grow up, and the other is the sexism they experience in the place they choose to live as adults,\" according to the research brief.\\n\\nWomen who were born in states with higher levels of sexism experienced larger gaps in wages and employment. They\\'re also more likely to get married or have a child earlier, the study suggests.\\n\\nLiving in a more sexist state as an adult is also likely to exacerbate those life decisions, according to the study.\\n\\nAs Business Insider previously reported, certain states have higher gender pay gaps than others \\u2014 and it seems to follow where the researchers noted sexism was highest. Places like New York, California, and Minnesota have relatively low gaps, while it\\'s higher in the deep south.\\n\\nAnd across the US, mothers earn less than women without children. Meanwhile, in 2016, fathers actually made more money than men without children; their weekly take-home pay was on average $152 higher.', u'Binance has destroyed Coinbase and other major exchanges on volume in 2018 despite criticism of its altcoin-heavy focus.\\n\\nThe latest issue of monitoring resource Diar\\u2019s newsletter presents startling data from some of the best-known cryptocurrency trading platforms with Coinbase\\u2019s overall volume plummeting 83 percent in the seven months to July.\\n\\nBitstamp handled 73 percent less volume in July than in January, while Binance\\u2019s volumes remained steady, even post a 21 percent increase last month versus June.\\n\\n\\u201cTraded volumes on Coinbase, Bitstamp and Kraken have seen steep declines,\\u201d Diar commented on the statistics.\\n\\nThe numbers cap an increasingly buoyant year for Binance, which has undergone major expansion to begin is European trading operations last week.\\n\\nThe fortunes of both the exchange and its native token Binance Coin (BNB) have been fuelled by aggressive altcoin trading policies, with the platform shielding itself from market downturns through altcoin trading availability, Diar suggests.\\n\\nAt the same time, cryptocurrency commentators have widely criticized Binance and its CEO Changpeng Zhou over alleged multimillion-dollar token listing fees, pseudo-decentralization claims, and a subjective selection process.\\n\\n\\u201cIf you have a decentralized cryptocurrency with a founder that disappeared you can never get listed on exchanges,\\u201d Twitter personality WhalePanda noted on Twitter in July, Bitcoinist reporting that according to Zhou\\u2019s guidelines, Bitcoin would struggle to list on Binance.\\n\\nNonetheless, the exchange\\u2019s success contrasts with the overall slump in altcoin profitability, assets outpacing Bitcoin\\u2019s losses in a bleed which accelerated in July.\\n\\nCoinbase appears to be increasing its interaction with altcoins, Diar notes, in a bid to win back market share, while also pursuing international expansion beyond US markets.\\n\\nIts decentralized bulletin board Paradex.io has beaten Binance to the DEX post, Zhou saying his own decentralized offering could one day replace the current incarnation of Binance altogether.\\n\\nWhat do you think about exchange trading volumes?

'Everything has been brutal,' says Larkin.\\n\\nLacey says wearing the monitoring device and hearing it beep when he gets too far is 'a constant slap in the face.'\\n\\nBoth of the men had been\\xa0fitted with the trackers after their homes were raided by the FBI, something Lacey likens to the same\\xa0'intense emotional violation' that he felt when his home was burgled when he was young.\\n\\nThey say that the case against them is politically motivated, and a trial date so far out is designed to force a plea.\\n\\nBut 'they're going to have to win this in court,' says Lacey, 'and we don't think they can. And our lawyers don't think they can.'\\n\\n'We didn't go looking for this fight,' says Lacey. 'But we didn't back away from it either.'\\n\\nThe men believe the US Attorney's Office is trying their best to rid them of their defense attorney through punitive financial depletion and by using the law in their favor.\\n\\n'They try to exhaust all your financial resources so that you can't afford these lawyers,' Lacey says, and 'if the lawyers are still around, they then move to get rid of the lawyer.'\\n\\nThey say the US Attorney's Office is trying to have their lawyer dismissed from the case after the lawyer worked with Carl Ferrer, the site's Chief Executive, in a conflict of interest argument.\\n\\n'You know, we think we will prevail if we're allowed to defend ourselves,' Larkin adds. 'If we're allowed to use our resources to defend ourselves in court, we will prevail.'\\n\\n'You know, there's this old, lame-ass horsesh** that priests and nuns will tell you about ''God doesn't give you a burden that you can't carry,'' Lacey says.\\n\\n'We will carry this burden, and we will f****** prevail at the end of this god damn sh**. But it's ugly in the middle.'\\n\\nThe men are also convinced their prosecution is politically motivated.\\n\\n'Part of the reason this has really worked is because you have Cindy and John McCain involved in this,' Larkin says, 'and they see an opportunity to even a score. We think there's no question that this is partly their doing.'\\n\\n'The fact that the law is clear about this [yet] they can still ignore it and play to the rafters, you know? That's politics,' says Lacey.\\n\\n'We've never, ever broken the law,' Larkin says. 'Never have, never wanted to. This isn't really\\u2014I know this is probably heresy\\u2014this isn't about sex work to me. This is about speech,' Larkin adds, sounding a bit like Larry Flynt of Hustler who stood against his own lewdness charges and won under First Amendment rights.\\n\\n'This is the biggest speech battle in America right now,' Lacey adds.\\n\\n'The First Amendment isn't about protecting the rights of the McLaughlin Group to speak their mind on television. This is specifically what the f*** it's about. Unpopular speech. Dangerous speech. Speech that threatens the norm. Not only do we have that right, our readers have that right.

GunnerVV/Flickr\\n\\nMickey's Not-So-Scary Halloween Party is about get started at Walt Disney World's Magic Kingdom, and we cannot wait for all of the spooky fun! With limited time character meet-and-greets, specialty food and beverages, ride layovers, and candy galore it can be overwhelming to figure out where to start or what to do. We've rounded up our best tips on how to experience Mickey's Not-So-Scary Halloween Party, and how to do the party like a Disney pro.\\n\\nGet in line early if you want to see your favorite character. Megan duBois\\n\\nThere are so many opportunities to see characters at Mickey's Not So Scary Halloween Party, from your favorite Disney pals in their Halloween costumes to rare meets with all seven dwarfs. If you're planning on doing any characters, your best bet is to get in line early, especially for rare or very popular characters. Those would include all seven dwarfs, Jack Skellington and Sally, and Moana. Guests can start getting into the park at 4:00 p.m., so that's when you should get in line. This might seem like a waste since the party doesn't start until 7:00 p.m., but typically these more popular characters will start meeting a little early around 6:30 p.m. If you're near the front of the line then you'll be able to meet them and grab a photo for Instagram before the party even starts!\\n\\nFor less popular characters, like the princesses who meet in the parks every day, or Mickey in his Halloween costume, getting in line during the party is fine, but the later in the party you hop in line, the less amount of time you'll have to wait.\\n\\nIf you aren't sure where certain characters are meeting be sure to grab a party map as you walk into Magic Kingdom, or ask a Cast Member.\\n\\nDon't miss out on the sweet treats. Megan duBois/INSIDER\\n\\nThere are always delicious treats to be had at Mickey's Not So Scary Halloween Party! While we don't know the full menu yet, we do know that they never start serving these until the party actually starts, so anytime after 7:00 p.m. you can grab what you'd like. Many times Magic Kingdom has a party-only souvenir glass that is very popular, so if you want one of those be sure to grab it towards the beginning of the party.\\n\\nSome of your favorite rides are getting a makeover for the event. Kim Renfro/INSIDER\\n\\nNew this year at Mickey's Not So Scary Halloween Party are ride layovers. If you've ever been to Disneyland or Disney's California Adventure you'll see holiday ride layovers throughout the parks, and now they are finally coming to the East Coast! There are going to be three different layovers all across Magic Kingdom. The Mad Tea Party will have new lighting and effects that will transform guests under the dancing lights. Pirates of the Caribbean will have live actors on the attraction sets who will interact with guests on the search for Gunpowder Pete. Lastly, Space Mountain will have a new soundtrack and special effects.\\n\\nWait until later in the night to snag your candy. Megan duBois/INSIDER\\n\\nEveryone loves getting their trick-or-treat bags filled at Mickey's Not So Scary Halloween Party, but doing this first is a waste of your valuable party time. Usually, later in the night, the lines for candy are much shorter than at the beginning of the party. If you go to a location with more than one Cast Member passing out candy, be sure to stop at both for maximum treats! If you wait until about the last 30 minutes of the party, Cast Members are trying to empty their bins of candy and tend to load up bags until they are completely full.\\n\\nCostumes are allowed for the event. Kent Phillips/Disney Parks\\n\\nEveryone is invited to wear a costume to Mickey's Not So Scary Halloween Party, but there are some guidelines you should know about. You cannot cover your face, nothing can drag on the ground, no weapons of any kind are permitted even if they are fake or plastic, and all costumes must be family-friendly. Other than those few rules, anything goes, so be as creative as you want!\\n\\nOne of the big sellers at Mickey's Not So Scary Halloween Party is the entertainment, from parades, fireworks, stage shows and more, there's so much to do. Be sure to grab a times guide when you walk into Magic Kingdom to plan out your night. A major pro tip is to watch the second showing of Mickey's Boo To You Halloween Parade, and watch it from Frontierland! It's typically less crowded and Frontierland is where the parade starts every night. The parade follows the same path as Festival of Fantasy so anywhere along the route is a good spot to watch from.\\n\\nThere's only one showing of Happy HalloWishes, and it's at 10:15 p.m. The best viewing is from the hub of Magic Kingdom, but the music is pumped throughout the park. If the hub is too busy for you, try watching from behind the castle in Fantasyland. There are three showings of the Hocus Pocus Villains Spelltacular, which is the stage show in front of Cinderella Castle. If you love the film Hocus Pocus, then you have to make time to watch this show! If you're already in the hub area for the fireworks then stay there and watch the show, which is right after the fireworks end. As people clear out, move up closer to the stage for a better view.\\n\\nHopefully, we helped you prepare a little more for Mickey's Not So Scary Halloween Party. You're sure to have a screamin' good time while you there!\\n\\nFor more great stories, head to INSIDER's homepage.\", u'The vechain price (VET/VEN) rose nearly 10 percent on Tuesday, even as the wider cryptocurrency market struggled just to tread water amidst declining trading volume.\\n\\nThe cryptocurrency, the native token of the eponymous IoT-focused VeChain platform, has been one of the market\\u2019s top performers in August, as CCN has already reported.\\n\\nThe vechain price continued its climb on Tuesday, rising approximately 9.5 percent for the day, even as no other top 20-cryptocurrency managed to make gains against the US dollar. VET is now up an astounding 107 percent for the week, providing it with a circulating valuation of $849 million at $0.015 per token and the 19th spot in the market cap rankings.\\n\\nThe vast majority of the token\\u2019s volume continues to coalesce on Binance, the world\\u2019s largest cryptocurrency exchange, with the platform\\u2019s VET/BTC and VET/USDT pairs accounting for more than 88 percent of all vechain trading.\\n\\nThere is no single prevailing theory for today\\u2019s market-leading vechain performance. However, it\\u2019s possible that investors are acting on the advice of documents, allegedly published on Monday by investment research firm Palm Beach Group and later leaked through VeChain social media channels, that encourage subscribers to purchase VET up to $0.016 in the short-term with a long-term target as high as $0.27 (The firm also has buy ratings on most other large-cap cryptocurrencies, so investors probably shouldn\\u2019t get too excited about this call).\\n\\nTaking a broader view of the market, most cryptocurrencies have taken a step back as overall trading volume in the spot market has declined by about 25 percent since last week. This trend has also been observed on bitcoin futures exchanges, where bitcoin futures volume has declined for three consecutive days and is down approximately 69 percent since last week.\\n\\nIt seems plausible that the market is holding its breath while awaiting the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission\\u2019s (SEC) impending rulings on two bitcoin ETF proposals, determinations which the agency is expected to deliver this week.\\n\\nWhile many analysts have said that they do not expect to see a bitcoin ETF until at least 2019, the market has nevertheless was nevertheless battered in recent weeks when the SEC denied the Winklevoss twins\\u2019 proposal (which, to be fair, was always a long shot) and delayed ruling on another application \\u2014 the VanEck-SolidX proposal, which many observers believe has a better shot \\u2014 until September.\\n\\nIf the market behaves similarly in the likely event that the SEC takes a similar position on the proposals that are currently sitting on its desk, it could breach BTC\\u2019s support levels, but it seems more plausible that traders will not so quickly make the same mistake of pricing in an approval that is not likely to materialize in the very near-term.', u'On May 29, a tediously \\u201cmysterious\\u201d video appeared in the bowels of YouTube. It featured a man wearing dark glasses, a thick beard, and a low-brimmed cap. He is seated in front of a shabby-chic fireplace, on which rests a half-drained wine glass. He speaks in a thick, vaguely Eastern European accent, digitally manipulated into an almost incomprehensible growl as he delivers what he describes as a \\u201cconfession.\\u201d\\n\\nThis apparent turncoat\\u2019s warning (which has since been removed from YouTube) followed rumors about something called IMMO that seem to have first appeared on May 18 on a small cryptocurrency news site called Zycrypto. Zycrypto summarized mainstream reports that the banks Goldman Sachs and ING were strengthening their ties to cryptocurrency businesses. But it added the claim that both ING and Goldman Sachs are \\u201cowned by the Rothschild Group.\\u201d The problem with this claim is obvious: \\u201cThe Rothschild Group\\u201d is a common name for Rothschild & Co., a European investment firm with a roughly $2.8 billion (2.45 billion euro) total market value. Goldman Sachs has a nearly $90 billion market cap, while ING is worth about $52 billion.\\n\\nZycrypto\\u2019s other claim was equally preposterous. Citing only information \\u201cleaked on social networks, including closed Telegram channels,\\u201d the post claimed that \\u201cthe Rothschild Group\\u201d was launching its own cryptocurrency project called IMMO. (I\\u2019m not linking to these articles or videos, or naming more of them than necessary, to reduce the risk of amplifying their distortions.)\\n\\nIn a statement to Slate, Rothschild & Co. denied any involvement with a cryptocurrency called IMMO and said it had no plans to launch any cryptocurrency at all. Nonetheless, other fringe-y news sites were happy to repeat the false claims and even elaborate on them. One, seemingly apropos of nothing, linked them to the recent announcement that George Soros\\u2019 family fund might invest in cryptocurrency. On May 23, another site went much further, freely speculating that the mysterious new IMMO cryptocurrency would be linked to \\u201cthe price of gold or other limited natural resources\\u201d and used to \\u201cmaintain control over the market of cryptocurrency.\\u201d It would also be \\u201clegally recognized in one of the sovereign countries controlled by the Rothschilds,\\u201d who \\u201chave been preserving and multiplying their capital many times over for two hundred years.\\u201d\\n\\nThis festering well of hate could explain some of the lack of diversity in the broader, fast-growing blockchain industry.\\n\\nClaims about the Rothschild family\\u2019s vast and secret wealth and their hidden control over entire nations are pillars of modern anti-Semitism. The Rothschilds\\u2019 supposed world dominance was the subject of one of the propaganda films Joseph Goebbels deployed to pave the way for the Holocaust. The fraudulent Protocols of the Elders of Zion elaborated on the \\u201cJewish banking conspiracy,\\u201d but that document was actually created by czarist secret police in pre-revolutionary Russia.\\n\\nDespite being debunked over and over again, these ideas have remained terrifyingly influential. Emmanuel Macron\\u2019s connections to Rothschild & Co. were weaponized in France\\u2019s 2017 election by far-right avatar Marine Le Pen, in what many read as an anti-Semitic dog whistle. George Soros, the liberal Jewish hedge fund magnate, has been the unlucky American inheritor of much of this madness, explaining his mention in connection with IMMO.\\n\\nThe dark fantasies swirling around IMMO seem to have been an effort to suture these toxic fictions onto the anti-authoritarian idealism behind bitcoin.\\n\\nBitcoin was launched in early 2009, in the throes of the global financial crisis, by a computer science genius still known only by the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. Nakamoto specifically positioned bitcoin as an alternative to the then-disgraced legacy financial institutions, and skepticism of banks is literally embedded into the system: A newspaper headline about a 2009 English bank bailout is permanently inscribed in bitcoin\\u2019s first batch of transactions, or \\u201cgenesis block.\\u201d\\n\\nOf course, skepticism of high finance is not inherently anti-Semitic, and most cryptocurrency advocates have shown no sign of picking up what IMMO is putting down. Vitalik Buterin, creator of Ethereum and perhaps the most revered figure in the industry, tried to tamp down Rothschild hysteria, writing on Reddit that \\u201cthey are just people born into various old-money-type high society positions, and the theories that they are anything beyond that are fairly baseless.\\u201d\\n\\nBut deep skepticism of banks makes some cryptocurrency supporters susceptible to the idea that a Jewish banking dynasty might launch a cryptocurrency intended to hijack the sector. That\\u2019s particularly true, it seems, of a small but influential subset of small-fry cryptocurrency day traders. These mostly young, mostly male speculators chase big gains trading highly speculative, penny stock\\u2013like \\u201caltcoins\\u201d inspired by bitcoin. These altcoins\\u2019 prices can fluctuate wildly based on rumor, speculation, and sentiment, and traders try to stay ahead of these moves by exchanging tips and leads on social media and in private chat rooms. At least among English-speaking traders, a major clearinghouse for those tips is the anonymous message board 4chan, in a subforum called /biz/ (which, despite its general-sounding name, is dedicated almost entirely to cryptocurrency).\\n\\nYou may know 4chan as a breeding ground for toxic online trolling, and particularly for the extremist alt-right strain that exploded into public consciousness in 2016. Just as memes spawned on 4chan spread to more mainstream sites like Facebook, consensus opinions of small blockchain projects\\u2014which are \\u201cshitcoins\\u201d destined to fail, and which will \\u201cmoon\\u201d to higher value\\u2014often take shape on /biz/ before trickling out to Reddit and Twitter. These discussions are infused with the blithely hateful lingua franca of 4chan as a whole. Pepe avatars are omnipresent, and the entire thesaurus of vile racial slurs are thrown around with abandon.\\n\\nBut it is Jews who come in for the most constant, focused, and elaborate derision. In a thread in response to the IMMO rumors, there was some skepticism of the specifics, but a broad consensus that Jews \\u201cown fucking everything\\u201d and \\u201chave siphoned money from the entire globe for 200 years with their global banking scheme.\\u201d In other threads, /biz/ denizens declared that \\u201cour government is controlled by these SJW kikes\\u201d and \\u201crich kikes love nothing more than spending other people\\u2019s money.\\u201d\\n\\nThere\\u2019s evidence that someone consciously tailored the IMMO conspiracy theory to appeal to these dismal prejudices. In addition to our heavily accented YouTube \\u201cinformant,\\u201d a writer named James Mayer penned a series of Medium posts warning about IMMO, one including a doctored photo of Buterin holding a sign reading \\u201cStop IMMO.\\u201d But \\u201cMayer\\u2019s\\u201d English is sloppy at best, there is no other sign of him online, and his profile picture appears to have been pulled from a Russian social media archive of images from an online suit retailer. In the Zycrypto post that seems to have set things off, one stray link leads to a site in Russian. That could provide a clue to the origins of the article, which is attributed to an anonymous \\u201cGuest Author.\\u201d (Zycrypto did not respond to questions regarding the article\\u2019s origins and the site\\u2019s editorial process.)\\n\\nThe spread of a groundless conspiracy theory on untrustworthy news sites is driven by a familiar motive. Such sites are hungry for eyeballs because they can make potentially serious money by selling ads for other (often dubious) cryptocurrency investments or services. But what about the deeper motives behind the IMMO rumors? One possible explanation was suggested by a perceptive commenter known as davis196 on the Bitcointalk forum: \\u201cPerhaps the IMMO developers are lying about this to make their project look more legit and trustworthy. That will bring a lot of unexperienced investors into this new platform.\\u201d In other words, IMMO might have been conceived as a novel kind of crypto \\u201cexit scam.\\u201d In most such schemes, which have been rampant in recent years, a team publishes ambitious plans for a cryptocurrency\\u2014often in the form of a \\u201cwhitepaper\\u201d\\u2014then sells digital tokens, supposedly to fund its development, before disappearing with investor funds.\\n\\nThe IMMO rumors could be a cynical evolution of the whitepaper scam model. Rumors connecting IMMO to the Rothschilds could actually motivate gullible anti-Semites to buy in, on the premise that a \\u201csecret\\u201d project of a vast Jewish banking conspiracy was sure to grow in value. Another anonymous forum poster arrived at that logic effortlessly, arguing that if the conspiracy is true, \\u201cthen buy \\u2026 this asset, if it will buy a lot of people, it can grow well.\\u201d IMMO would be immune to explicit denials of Rothschild & Co\\u2019s involvement, which could even leave fact-averse adherents more convinced that they were buying a stake in a project aimed at world domination. In other words, IMMO may be a real conspiracy\\u2014just not one involving the Rothschilds.\\n\\nWhoever is pushing the narrative does seem to have run out of steam. Though \\u201cJames Mayer\\u201d published another IMMO post to Medium in July, it has gotten very little traction, and the ominous \\u201cnews\\u201d posts about the Rothschilds have petered out on the fringe sites. That\\u2019s hugely to the credit of the cryptocurrency and blockchain community as a whole.\\n\\nBut for the /biz/ crowd, the underlying buzz of paranoid hatred hasn\\u2019t gone anywhere. In fact, it\\u2019s a particularly ripe moment for stoking anti-Semitic resentment in the cryptocurrency world, because so many who thought crypto was a chance for redemption have instead wound up fleeced. The end of 2017 saw feverish media hype as the value of cryptocurrencies skyrocketed, and glowing profiles of newly minted bitcoin millionaires drew legions of hopeful new speculators to the sector. But the market dropped dramatically in January and hasn\\u2019t recovered, wiping out speculators who bought in at the top of the bubble.\\n\\nOn /biz/, that has led many users to a place of frustration and despair. Perhaps the darkest message I found asked: \\u201cWhat\\u2019s the best way to off myself /biz? I cuck work in construction in a shit hole of a city and though I study my ass off in crypto when I have time, I just keep losing money in it not matter how solid the projects. I want to escape this fucked up life I currently have.\\u201d\\n\\nThreatening suicide on 4chan is itself often a kind of sport, but the sense of real hopelessness runs deep. Many posters ask for help finding a job so they can move out of their parents\\u2019 house. There seems to be little connection between these young men and the healthy economy outside their front doors, much less the \\u201clambos\\u201d jokingly flaunted by some of the crypto world\\u2019s top dogs.\\n\\nTheir despair, like bitcoin\\u2019s anti-banking worldview, is grounded in real issues, including rising inequality and stagnant wages. And it\\u2019s shared with many young white Americans, particularly the less educated. But /biz/ provides a disturbing window on what happens next, letting you watch practically in real time as economic hopelessness finds simple, convenient, and utterly mistaken targets. And such bitterness may actually be amplified by the media hype around those who have gotten wildly rich on their crypto investments\\u2014one /biz/ user described what seemed like his pretty decent IT job as \\u201cwageslaving for some corporate jew.\\u201d\\n\\nThat sort of vitriol might have once been dismissed as the vile but essentially harmless gibbering of a clutch of lost boys. But in 2018, anti-Semitism is roaring back, and on /biz/ as elsewhere, it\\u2019s closely linked with other kinds of hate. For instance, the board is full of references to \\u201cincel\\u201d culture, a strain of thought that demonizes women for refusing sex, and to MGTOW, or Men Going Their Own Way, an anti-feminist movement that calls on straight men to free themselves from the supposedly oppressive bonds of relationships with women. Incel discourse has, like anti-Semitic rhetoric before it, been closely tied to horrific crimes in the real world.\\n\\nLet\\u2019s be clear: The anonymous hatred on /biz/ doesn\\u2019t implicate the broader cryptocurrency community or blockchain industry, most of which is dedicated to transparency, open access, privacy, and other values that stand to benefit marginalized communities of all kinds. But bitcoin\\u2019s anti-banking rhetoric can be easily misconstrued or abused, and its division into haves and have-nots is fueling a wave of rage as dreams of easy money die. Hate speech, even if it remains speech, profoundly threatens the potential impact of cryptocurrency\\u2019s most idealistic innovations. Constant slurs thrown around a forum that also offers important information act as a significant barrier to people of color or women: One frequent /biz/ visitor, who is not white and monitors the board as part of his job in blockchain marketing, told me that reading it was a routinely traumatic experience. This festering well of hate could explain some of the lack of diversity in the broader, fast-growing blockchain industry.\\n\\nThe same goes for IMMO. Whether the conspiracy theory is a marketing campaign, a scam, or just clickbait, its creators and propagators are feeding the worst impulses of crypto\\u2019s id and betraying whatever idealism bitcoin can still lay claim to. There are many well-documented culprits for the inequality and exploitation that have made American society increasingly brutish and hopeless for some. Blaming a Jewish conspiracy is the ultimate sucker\\u2019s bet.', u'Gold. GOLD! Always believe in your soul.. Eddie Mulholland - WPA Pool/Getty Images\\n\\nBitcoin is the \"digital gold\" \\u2014 at least, that\\'s what its fervent advocates claim.\\n\\nThey argue that the buzzy digital currency is the 21st century\\'s answer to precious metals, and may one day replace gold as a major store of value for investors.\\n\\nBut is bitcoin likely to actually replace real gold in mainstream investors\\' eyes any time soon? According to Morningstar Equity Research analyst Kristoffer Inton, the answer is a resounding no.\\n\\nIn a recent research note for investors, the analyst laid out five criteria that gold, as a \"safe-haven investment,\" fulfills \\u2014 and that bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies would also need to succeed at in order to be considered as an investment on a par with (or superior to) the shiny precious metal.\\n\\nNotably, these criteria don\\'t include volatility \\u2014 something investors want to avoid at all costs for safe-haven investments. Bitcoin is, infamously, prone to extreme bouts of volatility. In the space of under a year, its price has skyrocketed from around $4,000 to almost $20,000, before falling back to around $6,500 today.\\n\\nSo what are they? The five areas are liquidity, functional purpose, scarcity of supply, future demand certainty, and permanence.\\n\\nGold successfully ticks the box on every one of these criteria, while bitcoin only manages two (at a push), Inton argues.\\n\\nFirst up, liquidity. An investment vehicle needs to be traded regularly, and bitcoin is remarkably illiquid, as crypto investors hoard (or \"hodl\") their digital coins. \"Current levels of trading see daily volume of roughly 0.5% of all existing bitcoins,\" Inton wrote. \"Gold averages more than 5 times as much volume, with nearly 3% of all existing gold being regularly traded.\"\\n\\nNext: As well as being a universally recognised store of value, gold actually has a functional purpose\\u2014 from its utilization in computer circuit boards to ornamental jewellery and teeth replacements. Bitcoin\\'s only purpose is as a currency and store of value \\u2014 and right now, it\\'s only rarely accepted for actual purchases (rather than speculative trades).\\n\\nBitcoin does, however, have scarcity of supply, a necessary component for retaining value. There will only ever be a maximum of 21 million bitcoins in existence, a rule written into its code from day one.\\n\\nIs there future demand certainty for bitcoin? That\\'s a very big unknown. The digital currency has been around for less than a decade, in a period of significant technological and political upheaval; even if cryptocurrencies catch on in the mainstream, there\\'s no guarantee bitcoin will be one of the ultimate winners. In contrast, gold has been universally accepted as valuable for more than 5,000 years of human history \\u2014 it\\'s a pretty safe bet for investors that it won\\'t have totally devalued a year from now.\\n\\nLastly, there\\'s permanence\\u2014 the question of whether the given investment resource itself degrades over time. Gold is a precious metal that doesn\\'t tarnish; bitcoin, too, won\\'t rot or deteriorate. (Though if people stop widely using bitcoin, the network will degrade in quality and could eventually disappear altogether; gold would continue to exist even if it ceased to be used as an investment vehicle tomorrow.)']\n"
