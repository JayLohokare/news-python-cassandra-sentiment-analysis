      "Twitter Facebook LinkedIn Tokens and several major cryptocurrencies such as EOS have demonstrated strong short-term momentum over the last 24 hours, pushing the valuation of the crypto market to $206 billion. The volume of Bitcoin, which declined to the mid-$3 billion region, recovered to $4.2 billion, showing a clear increase in trading activity across major cryptocurrency exchanges. Affected by the increase in the volume of Bitcoin, tokens and digital assets such as Loom, Status, Bancor, WaltonChain, Pundi X, OmiseGo, and Zcash recorded gains in the range of 8 to 20 percent, portraying large upside movements for the first time since September 15. What the Increase in the Volume of Bitcoin Means In previous reports, CCN reported that the low volume of Bitcoin has left the cryptocurrency market vulnerable to short-term drops, possibly below the $200 billion mark. At one point, the volume of Bitcoin fell to $3.1 billion, down nearly 26 percent from $4.2 billion. Technical analysts including Hsaka emphasized that the failure of Bitcoin to recover in volume could trigger the dominant cryptocurrency to maintain its tight range until the end of the year, which could prevent the initiation of 2019 with positive sentiment regarding cryptocurrencies as a growing asset class. “To be honest, with volume and volatility petering out, I wouldn’t be surprised to see BTC hold this range for another month (and maybe till the EOY too). Would be the path of maximum pain, bears don’t get their rapid selloff to 4.8k, bulls distraught over not being able to break 6.8k,” Hsaka explained. In early 2019, specifically in February, several major announcements await Bitcoin. Most importantly, the final deadline of the VanEck/SolidX Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) application is set to be evaluated by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) by the end of February 2019. If Bitcoin can initiate a major positive price movement prior to the year’s end impacted by the launch of BTC futures markets by Bakkt and Goldman Sachs, a positive sentiment could be carried out into the first quarter of 2019. A positive sentiment from 2018 combined with an approval of a Bitcoin ETF could have a drastic impact on the price of Bitcoin and the valuation of the cryptocurrency market that could potentially trigger a strong mid-term rally. Hence, in the short-term, at least by the end of November, it is important for BTC and the rest of the crypto market to demonstrate some momentum supported by decent volume to prevent the current negative sentiment in the global market being carried into next year. Risky Trades In general, the vast majority of tokens and small market cryptocurrencies have recorded 5 to 10 percent gains in the past 12 hours. ICON, Decentraland, Polymath, Tron, Aelf, Aion, and many other tokens that have poorly performed against both BTC and the US dollar have demonstrated strong short-term movements. It is possible that the increase in the volume of Bitcoin was triggered by bulls in the market trying to push the cryptocurrency market out of its low price range to defend the $6,000 support level and achieve minor resistance levels in the mid-$6,000 region for BTC.

      "Twitter Facebook LinkedIn Intrigue abounds around the allegedly Singapore-based WEX exchange, whose ownership and activities have both been called into question in recent months. Particularly of interest was the exchange listing a much higher market price for BTC and weirdly overcharging for USDT. CCN previously gave our readers an overly interesting report on the exchange in which writer Conor Maloney explained: WEX is a rebranded version of the BTC-e exchange which was shut down in connection to a multi-billion dollar money laundering operation with a Russian national named Alexander Vinnik reportedly charged in connection with the criminal operation. Singapore business records indicate that the exchange is officially owned by one Dmitry Vasiliev, but he recently claimed to have lost control of the exchange and was unable to clarify exactly who was in charge. RBK reports that a former Soviet militiaman called Dmitry Khavchenko was plannning on buying the exchange – Khavchenko is a Ukranian militia member with the callsign ‘Sailor’ and fought in Crimea to support the Russian annexation in 2014, seen in this video armed with a machine gun handing over to authorities the flight recorders from the Malaysian Flight 17 jet that was shot down over Ukraine in 2014 killing 283 passengers and 15 crew. Binance Freezes WEX Accounts Caught Moving Customer Funds According to reporting in the cryptomedia and the CEO of Binance himself, WEX has been caught moving millions of dollars in cryptos from its exchange through the largest exchange by volume, and Binance has in turn frozen the accounts and requested the public to contact law enforcement agencies. the identified accounts are frozen, please report to law enforcement and have a case number. We will work with LE. This is part of centralization we hate too, dealing with other exchanges mess (we dont even know the details). But we will do what we can. https://t.co/tgyYI5ptqx — CZ Binance (@cz_binance) October 30, 2018 WEX has previously frozen withdrawals and it seems likely that the problems on the exchange continue. Previous to its negative coverage regarding the withdrawal problems and its strange prices, WEX was an unknown quantity. Frequently people run into trouble when dealing with small, unknown exchanges, leading experts to advise that people stick with large-scale, regulated, known exchanges in all cases. The high price of BTC on the exchange continues today and the exchange has not tweeted since August. Several clients of WEX have complained loudly on Twitter and elsewhere regarding the lack of withdrawals. hi @cz_binance if @WEXnz is included this situation pls do not unfreeze the account until they let the withdraws… @WEXnz is one of the the biggest fraud of crypto — gambinocrypto (@gambinocrypto) October 30, 2018 An unofficial Reddit page is filled with complaints, and one user has decided to take legal action in the form of a class action suit. Users also have perhaps unrealistic hopes that the Binance account freezing will result in Binance honoring the funds of WEX users – something that would be highly unusual. What Binance can do, however, is comply with law enforcement and ultimately return funds to users in that manner. The news of Binance freezing the funds of WEX officials comes on the heels of a meltdown at MapleChange which resulted in tens of thousands of dollars in cryptocurrencies being lost. The episodes reinforce expert advice that the use of small and unregulated exchanges, even if it appears one will make a great deal in arbitrage, is probably best avoided.

      "Big investors poured $81 million into cryptocurrency products offered by Grayscale Investments in the third quarter of 2018 and $330 million so far this year, according to a new report from the crypto asset manager. The figures reflect record levels of interest among institutional investors, and come as a piece of good news for the cryptocurrency market, which has been mired in a prolonged price slump since last December. Grayscale, which is a subsidiary of the crypto conglomerate Digital Currency Group, offers a series of funds dedicated to individual cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin and XRP. The funds sell the currencies in the form of shares in a trust, and provide a means for institutional investors, many of which are barred from buying cryptocurrency directly, with exposure to the market. The report suggests that, even as consumer interest in cryptocurrency has waned, demand is stronger than ever from the likes of pension funds and family offices. The $330 million figure is remarkable given that the total inflow into Grayscale’s products for the first three quarters of 2017 totaled $21 million. In 2016, the comparable figure was $17 million. While Grayscale has added new types of cryptocurrency in recent months, including a privacy-focused coin called Zen, Bitcoin remains by far its most popular asset choice, accounting for 73% of total inflows. Here’s a chart from the report showing cumulative investments: “These figures are evidence that interest has not dwindled as a result of prices decreasing. What we’ve witnessed is the strongest inflows we’ve ever experienced over 5 years from both existing investors and new investors,” said Michael Sonnenshein, managing director of Grayscale. Grayscale’s report is consistent with other recent findings, including an investment note this week from Morgan Stanley, which show strong institutional interest in cryptocurrencies: Still, as MS identifies, the retail market appears to be standing still while institutions wade in pic.twitter.com/x2UsrXhua0 — Frank Chaparro (@fintechfrank) November 1, 2018 Meanwhile, as Fortune reported in September, more than half of trading volume at exchange behemoth Coinbase, which made its name serving retail investors, now comes from professional traders and institutional investors. All of this suggests that institutional capital could serve as a stabilizing long term force for volatile cryptocurrency markets. According to Sonnenshein, large investors are attracted to the market in part because it provides a means to gain exposure to new protocols and technologies associated with blockchain.\n",

      "Bitcoin prices continue to drag lower this year as retail interest fizzles. But institutional investors seem to be picking up that slack, and led the worlds largest digital currency investment firm to notch record inflows this year. New York- based Grayscale, a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, brought in $81.1 million in total investments for the third quarter, according to a company report published Thursday. The 33 percent uptick from the previous three months brings Grayscales inflows for the year to $330 million, its strongest year-to-date total since the firm started five years ago. At this time last year, the firm had raised a total $25.4 million by comparison. The firm now has $1.5 billion in customer assets. \"Bitcoin prices doing nothing but go down the entire year has not deterred our existing clients from putting more capital to work,\" Michael Sonnenshein, managing director of Grayscale Investment, told CNBC. \"Asset inflows are really strong despite these price declines.\" Of those inflows, roughly 70 percent were from institutional investors, meaning hedge funds, pensions or endowments. Grayscales nine cryptocurrency products are only available to accredited investors, not retail buyers who helped boost prices 1,300 percent last year. Grayscales other clients are mostly high net-worth individuals or family offices. Despite the rise of smaller alternatives like ether or XRP known as \"alt coins,\" bitcoin is still \"king\" of cryptocurrencies for investors, Grayscale said, In the third quarter, 73 percent of inflows were into the Bitcoin Investment Trust, which trades on over the over-the-counter markets under the ticker GBTC. Despite being \"king,\" bitcoin is still down more than 55 percent this year and was trading near $6,300 Thursday, according to data from CoinDesk.\n",

      "Twitter Facebook LinkedIn Tokens and several major cryptocurrencies such as EOS have demonstrated strong short-term momentum over the last 24 hours, pushing the valuation of the crypto market to $206 billion. The volume of Bitcoin, which declined to the mid-$3 billion region, recovered to $4.2 billion, showing a clear increase in trading activity across major cryptocurrency exchanges. Affected by the increase in the volume of Bitcoin, tokens and digital assets such as Loom, Status, Bancor, WaltonChain, Pundi X, OmiseGo, and Zcash recorded gains in the range of 8 to 20 percent, portraying large upside movements for the first time since September 15. What the Increase in the Volume of Bitcoin Means In previous reports, CCN reported that the low volume of Bitcoin has left the cryptocurrency market vulnerable to short-term drops, possibly below the $200 billion mark. At one point, the volume of Bitcoin fell to $3.1 billion, down nearly 26 percent from $4.2 billion. Technical analysts including Hsaka emphasized that the failure of Bitcoin to recover in volume could trigger the dominant cryptocurrency to maintain its tight range until the end of the year, which could prevent the initiation of 2019 with positive sentiment regarding cryptocurrencies as a growing asset class. “To be honest, with volume and volatility petering out, I wouldn’t be surprised to see BTC hold this range for another month (and maybe till the EOY too). Would be the path of maximum pain, bears don’t get their rapid selloff to 4.8k, bulls distraught over not being able to break 6.8k,” Hsaka explained. In early 2019, specifically in February, several major announcements await Bitcoin. Most importantly, the final deadline of the VanEck/SolidX Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) application is set to be evaluated by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) by the end of February 2019. If Bitcoin can initiate a major positive price movement prior to the year’s end impacted by the launch of BTC futures markets by Bakkt and Goldman Sachs, a positive sentiment could be carried out into the first quarter of 2019. A positive sentiment from 2018 combined with an approval of a Bitcoin ETF could have a drastic impact on the price of Bitcoin and the valuation of the cryptocurrency market that could potentially trigger a strong mid-term rally. Hence, in the short-term, at least by the end of November, it is important for BTC and the rest of the crypto market to demonstrate some momentum supported by decent volume to prevent the current negative sentiment in the global market being carried into next year. Risky Trades In general, the vast majority of tokens and small market cryptocurrencies have recorded 5 to 10 percent gains in the past 12 hours. ICON, Decentraland, Polymath, Tron, Aelf, Aion, and many other tokens that have poorly performed against both BTC and the US dollar have demonstrated strong short-term movements. It is possible that the increase in the volume of Bitcoin was triggered by bulls in the market trying to push the cryptocurrency market out of its low price range to defend the $6,000 support level and achieve minor resistance levels in the mid-$6,000 region for BTC.

    "test = \"The race to build the best public blockchain will be won by those that would scale in line with volume. On a Sunday, a blockchain project realistically did it, though for 24 hours. Waves Platform, comprising of a digital ledger project and decentralized exchange (DEX), processed 6.1 million real-time transactions in a stress test. As it found, the network faced no disruptions or delays as the test intensified. None of the transactions on its system – undertaken by users for DEX orders, transfers, token creation, etc. – experienced any slowdown, either. The Waves blockchain, according to data provided by PYWAVES, recorded a total of 108,741 transactions. Among them, 60,933 were Mass Transfers which, per Waves blog post, are specialized transactions that can hold 100 transfer at once. “A total of 6,141,108 transfers was processed by the network, with the blockchain supporting hundreds of transactions per second at peak times,” the post claimed. The platform euphorically claimed that it was the highest number of transactions ever processed by any public blockchain. Waves NG Several blockchain projects in the crypto space are attempting to find alternatives to Bitcoin’s slow transaction confirmation periods. Ethereum was posed as a solution. But, it faced the same problem CryptoKitties – a decentralized application launched on Ethereum’s blockchain – slowed down transactions on the network. While Bitcoin has opted for third-party solutions like Lightning Network to handle the volume [temporarily], Ethereum is following a test-and-implement approach by taking in answers from its community developers. Waves, to achieve a similar goal, have implemented a tech called Waves NG that helps to scale the Waves Network by selecting miners in advance, thus minimizing latency and maximizing throughput. According to Waves’ CEO and co-founder Sasha Ivanov, the protocol’s deployment on their blockchain helped them process the record transactions. “Bitcoin processes just a few transactions per second,” he said. “Ethereum’s capacity is into double-digit tps, and a handful of other blockchains have improved on this incrementally in various ways. WAVES has implemented tech that enables a step-change in transaction volumes — not just in the lab, but in the real world, on MainNet, as these figures prove beyond doubt.” The Waves post noted that other blockchain projects had not exceeded more than 2 million transactions per day. However, a tweet from Ivanov admitted that EOS, a semi-decentralized blockchain project, had in fact executed 5 million transactions within a 24-hour period. EOS had 5.5 mil at most. — Sasha Ivanov (@sasha35625) October 23, 2018 A commentator also posted a chart from Blocktivity that suggested Waves was behind five blockchain projects concerning transaction volume. The chart later earned the “bogus” status from one of the Waves followers. Featured image from Shutterstock.\"\n"
