      "Twitter Facebook LinkedIn Tokens and several major cryptocurrencies such as EOS have demonstrated strong short-term momentum over the last 24 hours, pushing the valuation of the crypto market to $206 billion. The volume of Bitcoin, which declined to the mid-$3 billion region, recovered to $4.2 billion, showing a clear increase in trading activity across major cryptocurrency exchanges. Affected by the increase in the volume of Bitcoin, tokens and digital assets such as Loom, Status, Bancor, WaltonChain, Pundi X, OmiseGo, and Zcash recorded gains in the range of 8 to 20 percent, portraying large upside movements for the first time since September 15. What the Increase in the Volume of Bitcoin Means In previous reports, CCN reported that the low volume of Bitcoin has left the cryptocurrency market vulnerable to short-term drops, possibly below the $200 billion mark. At one point, the volume of Bitcoin fell to $3.1 billion, down nearly 26 percent from $4.2 billion. Technical analysts including Hsaka emphasized that the failure of Bitcoin to recover in volume could trigger the dominant cryptocurrency to maintain its tight range until the end of the year, which could prevent the initiation of 2019 with positive sentiment regarding cryptocurrencies as a growing asset class. “To be honest, with volume and volatility petering out, I wouldn’t be surprised to see BTC hold this range for another month (and maybe till the EOY too). Would be the path of maximum pain, bears don’t get their rapid selloff to 4.8k, bulls distraught over not being able to break 6.8k,” Hsaka explained. In early 2019, specifically in February, several major announcements await Bitcoin. Most importantly, the final deadline of the VanEck/SolidX Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) application is set to be evaluated by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) by the end of February 2019. If Bitcoin can initiate a major positive price movement prior to the year’s end impacted by the launch of BTC futures markets by Bakkt and Goldman Sachs, a positive sentiment could be carried out into the first quarter of 2019. A positive sentiment from 2018 combined with an approval of a Bitcoin ETF could have a drastic impact on the price of Bitcoin and the valuation of the cryptocurrency market that could potentially trigger a strong mid-term rally. Hence, in the short-term, at least by the end of November, it is important for BTC and the rest of the crypto market to demonstrate some momentum supported by decent volume to prevent the current negative sentiment in the global market being carried into next year. Risky Trades In general, the vast majority of tokens and small market cryptocurrencies have recorded 5 to 10 percent gains in the past 12 hours. ICON, Decentraland, Polymath, Tron, Aelf, Aion, and many other tokens that have poorly performed against both BTC and the US dollar have demonstrated strong short-term movements. It is possible that the increase in the volume of Bitcoin was triggered by bulls in the market trying to push the cryptocurrency market out of its low price range to defend the $6,000 support level and achieve minor resistance levels in the mid-$6,000 region for BTC.

      "Twitter Facebook LinkedIn Intrigue abounds around the allegedly Singapore-based WEX exchange, whose ownership and activities have both been called into question in recent months. Particularly of interest was the exchange listing a much higher market price for BTC and weirdly overcharging for USDT. CCN previously gave our readers an overly interesting report on the exchange in which writer Conor Maloney explained: WEX is a rebranded version of the BTC-e exchange which was shut down in connection to a multi-billion dollar money laundering operation with a Russian national named Alexander Vinnik reportedly charged in connection with the criminal operation. Singapore business records indicate that the exchange is officially owned by one Dmitry Vasiliev, but he recently claimed to have lost control of the exchange and was unable to clarify exactly who was in charge. RBK reports that a former Soviet militiaman called Dmitry Khavchenko was plannning on buying the exchange – Khavchenko is a Ukranian militia member with the callsign ‘Sailor’ and fought in Crimea to support the Russian annexation in 2014, seen in this video armed with a machine gun handing over to authorities the flight recorders from the Malaysian Flight 17 jet that was shot down over Ukraine in 2014 killing 283 passengers and 15 crew. Binance Freezes WEX Accounts Caught Moving Customer Funds According to reporting in the cryptomedia and the CEO of Binance himself, WEX has been caught moving millions of dollars in cryptos from its exchange through the largest exchange by volume, and Binance has in turn frozen the accounts and requested the public to contact law enforcement agencies. the identified accounts are frozen, please report to law enforcement and have a case number. We will work with LE. This is part of centralization we hate too, dealing with other exchanges mess (we dont even know the details). But we will do what we can. https://t.co/tgyYI5ptqx — CZ Binance (@cz_binance) October 30, 2018 WEX has previously frozen withdrawals and it seems likely that the problems on the exchange continue. Previous to its negative coverage regarding the withdrawal problems and its strange prices, WEX was an unknown quantity. Frequently people run into trouble when dealing with small, unknown exchanges, leading experts to advise that people stick with large-scale, regulated, known exchanges in all cases. The high price of BTC on the exchange continues today and the exchange has not tweeted since August. Several clients of WEX have complained loudly on Twitter and elsewhere regarding the lack of withdrawals. hi @cz_binance if @WEXnz is included this situation pls do not unfreeze the account until they let the withdraws… @WEXnz is one of the the biggest fraud of crypto — gambinocrypto (@gambinocrypto) October 30, 2018 An unofficial Reddit page is filled with complaints, and one user has decided to take legal action in the form of a class action suit. Users also have perhaps unrealistic hopes that the Binance account freezing will result in Binance honoring the funds of WEX users – something that would be highly unusual. What Binance can do, however, is comply with law enforcement and ultimately return funds to users in that manner. The news of Binance freezing the funds of WEX officials comes on the heels of a meltdown at MapleChange which resulted in tens of thousands of dollars in cryptocurrencies being lost. The episodes reinforce expert advice that the use of small and unregulated exchanges, even if it appears one will make a great deal in arbitrage, is probably best avoided.

      "Big investors poured $81 million into cryptocurrency products offered by Grayscale Investments in the third quarter of 2018 and $330 million so far this year, according to a new report from the crypto asset manager. The figures reflect record levels of interest among institutional investors, and come as a piece of good news for the cryptocurrency market, which has been mired in a prolonged price slump since last December. Grayscale, which is a subsidiary of the crypto conglomerate Digital Currency Group, offers a series of funds dedicated to individual cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin and XRP. The funds sell the currencies in the form of shares in a trust, and provide a means for institutional investors, many of which are barred from buying cryptocurrency directly, with exposure to the market. The report suggests that, even as consumer interest in cryptocurrency has waned, demand is stronger than ever from the likes of pension funds and family offices. The $330 million figure is remarkable given that the total inflow into Grayscale’s products for the first three quarters of 2017 totaled $21 million. In 2016, the comparable figure was $17 million. While Grayscale has added new types of cryptocurrency in recent months, including a privacy-focused coin called Zen, Bitcoin remains by far its most popular asset choice, accounting for 73% of total inflows. Here’s a chart from the report showing cumulative investments: “These figures are evidence that interest has not dwindled as a result of prices decreasing. What we’ve witnessed is the strongest inflows we’ve ever experienced over 5 years from both existing investors and new investors,” said Michael Sonnenshein, managing director of Grayscale. Grayscale’s report is consistent with other recent findings, including an investment note this week from Morgan Stanley, which show strong institutional interest in cryptocurrencies: Still, as MS identifies, the retail market appears to be standing still while institutions wade in pic.twitter.com/x2UsrXhua0 — Frank Chaparro (@fintechfrank) November 1, 2018 Meanwhile, as Fortune reported in September, more than half of trading volume at exchange behemoth Coinbase, which made its name serving retail investors, now comes from professional traders and institutional investors. All of this suggests that institutional capital could serve as a stabilizing long term force for volatile cryptocurrency markets. According to Sonnenshein, large investors are attracted to the market in part because it provides a means to gain exposure to new protocols and technologies associated with blockchain.\n",

      "Bitcoin prices continue to drag lower this year as retail interest fizzles. But institutional investors seem to be picking up that slack, and led the worlds largest digital currency investment firm to notch record inflows this year. New York- based Grayscale, a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, brought in $81.1 million in total investments for the third quarter, according to a company report published Thursday. The 33 percent uptick from the previous three months brings Grayscales inflows for the year to $330 million, its strongest year-to-date total since the firm started five years ago. At this time last year, the firm had raised a total $25.4 million by comparison. The firm now has $1.5 billion in customer assets. \"Bitcoin prices doing nothing but go down the entire year has not deterred our existing clients from putting more capital to work,\" Michael Sonnenshein, managing director of Grayscale Investment, told CNBC. \"Asset inflows are really strong despite these price declines.\" Of those inflows, roughly 70 percent were from institutional investors, meaning hedge funds, pensions or endowments. Grayscales nine cryptocurrency products are only available to accredited investors, not retail buyers who helped boost prices 1,300 percent last year. Grayscales other clients are mostly high net-worth individuals or family offices. Despite the rise of smaller alternatives like ether or XRP known as \"alt coins,\" bitcoin is still \"king\" of cryptocurrencies for investors, Grayscale said, In the third quarter, 73 percent of inflows were into the Bitcoin Investment Trust, which trades on over the over-the-counter markets under the ticker GBTC. Despite being \"king,\" bitcoin is still down more than 55 percent this year and was trading near $6,300 Thursday, according to data from CoinDesk.\n",

      "Twitter Facebook LinkedIn Tokens and several major cryptocurrencies such as EOS have demonstrated strong short-term momentum over the last 24 hours, pushing the valuation of the crypto market to $206 billion. The volume of Bitcoin, which declined to the mid-$3 billion region, recovered to $4.2 billion, showing a clear increase in trading activity across major cryptocurrency exchanges. Affected by the increase in the volume of Bitcoin, tokens and digital assets such as Loom, Status, Bancor, WaltonChain, Pundi X, OmiseGo, and Zcash recorded gains in the range of 8 to 20 percent, portraying large upside movements for the first time since September 15. What the Increase in the Volume of Bitcoin Means In previous reports, CCN reported that the low volume of Bitcoin has left the cryptocurrency market vulnerable to short-term drops, possibly below the $200 billion mark. At one point, the volume of Bitcoin fell to $3.1 billion, down nearly 26 percent from $4.2 billion. Technical analysts including Hsaka emphasized that the failure of Bitcoin to recover in volume could trigger the dominant cryptocurrency to maintain its tight range until the end of the year, which could prevent the initiation of 2019 with positive sentiment regarding cryptocurrencies as a growing asset class. “To be honest, with volume and volatility petering out, I wouldn’t be surprised to see BTC hold this range for another month (and maybe till the EOY too). Would be the path of maximum pain, bears don’t get their rapid selloff to 4.8k, bulls distraught over not being able to break 6.8k,” Hsaka explained. In early 2019, specifically in February, several major announcements await Bitcoin. Most importantly, the final deadline of the VanEck/SolidX Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) application is set to be evaluated by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) by the end of February 2019. If Bitcoin can initiate a major positive price movement prior to the year’s end impacted by the launch of BTC futures markets by Bakkt and Goldman Sachs, a positive sentiment could be carried out into the first quarter of 2019. A positive sentiment from 2018 combined with an approval of a Bitcoin ETF could have a drastic impact on the price of Bitcoin and the valuation of the cryptocurrency market that could potentially trigger a strong mid-term rally. Hence, in the short-term, at least by the end of November, it is important for BTC and the rest of the crypto market to demonstrate some momentum supported by decent volume to prevent the current negative sentiment in the global market being carried into next year. Risky Trades In general, the vast majority of tokens and small market cryptocurrencies have recorded 5 to 10 percent gains in the past 12 hours. ICON, Decentraland, Polymath, Tron, Aelf, Aion, and many other tokens that have poorly performed against both BTC and the US dollar have demonstrated strong short-term movements. It is possible that the increase in the volume of Bitcoin was triggered by bulls in the market trying to push the cryptocurrency market out of its low price range to defend the $6,000 support level and achieve minor resistance levels in the mid-$6,000 region for BTC.

      "Twitter Facebook LinkedIn Intrigue abounds around the allegedly Singapore-based WEX exchange, whose ownership and activities have both been called into question in recent months. Particularly of interest was the exchange listing a much higher market price for BTC and weirdly overcharging for USDT. CCN previously gave our readers an overly interesting report on the exchange in which writer Conor Maloney explained: WEX is a rebranded version of the BTC-e exchange which was shut down in connection to a multi-billion dollar money laundering operation with a Russian national named Alexander Vinnik reportedly charged in connection with the criminal operation. Singapore business records indicate that the exchange is officially owned by one Dmitry Vasiliev, but he recently claimed to have lost control of the exchange and was unable to clarify exactly who was in charge. RBK reports that a former Soviet militiaman called Dmitry Khavchenko was plannning on buying the exchange – Khavchenko is a Ukranian militia member with the callsign ‘Sailor’ and fought in Crimea to support the Russian annexation in 2014, seen in this video armed with a machine gun handing over to authorities the flight recorders from the Malaysian Flight 17 jet that was shot down over Ukraine in 2014 killing 283 passengers and 15 crew. Binance Freezes WEX Accounts Caught Moving Customer Funds According to reporting in the cryptomedia and the CEO of Binance himself, WEX has been caught moving millions of dollars in cryptos from its exchange through the largest exchange by volume, and Binance has in turn frozen the accounts and requested the public to contact law enforcement agencies. the identified accounts are frozen, please report to law enforcement and have a case number. We will work with LE. This is part of centralization we hate too, dealing with other exchanges mess (we dont even know the details). But we will do what we can. https://t.co/tgyYI5ptqx — CZ Binance (@cz_binance) October 30, 2018 WEX has previously frozen withdrawals and it seems likely that the problems on the exchange continue. Previous to its negative coverage regarding the withdrawal problems and its strange prices, WEX was an unknown quantity. Frequently people run into trouble when dealing with small, unknown exchanges, leading experts to advise that people stick with large-scale, regulated, known exchanges in all cases. The high price of BTC on the exchange continues today and the exchange has not tweeted since August. Several clients of WEX have complained loudly on Twitter and elsewhere regarding the lack of withdrawals. hi @cz_binance if @WEXnz is included this situation pls do not unfreeze the account until they let the withdraws… @WEXnz is one of the the biggest fraud of crypto — gambinocrypto (@gambinocrypto) October 30, 2018 An unofficial Reddit page is filled with complaints, and one user has decided to take legal action in the form of a class action suit. Users also have perhaps unrealistic hopes that the Binance account freezing will result in Binance honoring the funds of WEX users – something that would be highly unusual. What Binance can do, however, is comply with law enforcement and ultimately return funds to users in that manner. The news of Binance freezing the funds of WEX officials comes on the heels of a meltdown at MapleChange which resulted in tens of thousands of dollars in cryptocurrencies being lost. The episodes reinforce expert advice that the use of small and unregulated exchanges, even if it appears one will make a great deal in arbitrage, is probably best avoided.

      "Twitter Facebook LinkedIn The world’s largest bitcoin ATM company has finally received official approval to operate in New York. They had previously been operating in New York almost since the company’s inception via a provisional license. Last year, they received coverage in the New Yorker and have frequently been in the news with word of new ATMs across the country. Coinsource is creeping toward 200 machines, the majority of which are two-way ATMs — meaning that users can buy and sell bitcoin through them. Coinsource ATMs support transactions from $5 to a limit of $5,000 per day. BitLicense #9 Coinsource believes that real-world bitcoin ATMs are important for the adoption of bitcoin as a whole. According to an external spokesperson, regulations are worth the wait in that they “legitimize” things. Speaking of their BitLicense being granted, she said: “Coinsource has been operating with a provisional license within that state, so the approval of the license does not necessarily change the service, but further legitimizes the company as a whole. Being granted an official license is a huge step towards general adoption. […] This milestone demonstrates to both other crypto companies and the general public that if you remain compliant and play by the rules, you will be rewarded.” Coinsource CEO Sheffield Clark added in a statement: “From the onset, our goal was to provide millions of Americans with a reliable and convenient way to buy digital currency. Bitcoin is no longer a fringe currency, and in 2018, is increasingly being adopted by the mainstream. Today, with the issuance of the virtual currency trading license to a BTM operator, the bitcoin industry takes another step toward public adoption.” Coinsource is the first and only bitcoin ATM operator to be granted a full BitLicense. New York being the hub of finance in the United States, it presents an important opportunity to expand the userbase of bitcoin and later other cryptocurrencies as a whole. BitLicense Frequent Source of Frustration to bitcoiners Whether or not the regulations will have a positive or negative impact on bitcoin companies remains to be seen. Regulation, in general, can have both positive and negative impacts on innovation, but in the case of the BitLicense, it can be argued that it discourages companies from operating in cryptocurrencies rather than another type of regulation which might encourage them to do so. The BitLicense has been an intense subject of debate and worry since it was first proposed and later implemented by the New York Department of Financial Services. Several exchanges and other bitcoin service providers no longer work in New York State as a result of the licensing scheme, which many believe opens the door for favoritism and the picking of winners, among other problems.

Bitcoin Press Release: Decentralized gaming platform TriForce Tokens, continues to disrupt the online gaming industry, focusing on the Latin American market with a recent partnership with Busca Todo. October 30, 2018, Milton Keynes – Disrupting the global gaming market with its innovative blockchain solutions, TriForce Tokens has made significant impacts on the industry. Not satisfied to limit its ambitions to limited markets, the UK-based gaming platform has made substantial efforts to break into the Latin American market, with a huge partnership with Busca Todo. The partnership was followed recently with the launch of the first ever blockchain-back Steam game, Eximius: Seize the Frontline. The TriForce Tokens is currently in the final stage of its token sale, which finishes on the 11th of November, 2018. Booming Market The Latin American gaming sector is the second largest in the world. In 2017 alone, the industry made USD 4.1 billion, with Mexico leading the way with USD 1.4 billion. The market is growing rapidly, thanks to the efforts of the government’s early on in the 2000s to encourage digital gaming development. Prime examples of the efforts are the 5% of GDP dedicated to the industry by Mexico and state-owned Ingenio Uruguay’s incubator releasing successful games such as 1811 and D.E.D. Busca Todo’s and Level-Up Busca Todo is the leading video game publisher in the Latin American market. The organization’s main aim is to boost the Spanish speaking industry by offering them a platform to not only launch but also advertise, raise funding and reaching out to millions of gamers worldwide. The partnership with Busca Todo gives the TriForce Tokens the perfect launch pad to enter the South American Market. Busca Todo’s Level-Up is the leading online gaming community in the Latin American market. With the platform having a global subscriber base for game reviews, shows, discussion, social networking, and the YouTube Level Up channel crossing the 1 million viewership mark, it brings a huge penetration for TriForce Tokens in the market. Speaking about the partnership, Pete Mardell, CEO of TriForce Tokens said: “We are fortunate to have found a partner that shares our vision and has the capacity to deliver on it with us, while providing us a strategic link to the largest emerging games industry region, Latin America” TriForce Tokens, for its part, will enable the market to increase the interaction of gamers and developers, substantially reduce distribution costs, combat piracy, offers cross-platform compatibility, in-game wealth retention and offer an increased level of interaction for the gaming community. Juan Pablo Rodriguez as the General Director stated: “speaking of the present and the future of gaming, Triforce is the vision that pushes for innovation in the industry. We are very proud to partner with Triforce making history every step of the way, by introducing new technology to the Latin American video gaming market” A Force to Reckon With TriForce Tokens has created an immense following and is rapidly expanding its ecosystem. The successful launch of Eximius: Seize the Frontline, a hybrid FPS and RTS domination game on Steam leads the way. The game is already attracting huge crowds. With the Halloween festivities just around the corner, the game developers have released a thematic special event for the game. TriForce Tokens is also developing a discord marketplace and game, along with a Twitch Streamer live bot. The sale of the platform’s FORCE tokens is in its final offering. That will end on 11th of November. Currently, the FORCE is available for USD 0.15 per token and carries a 5% bonus until 28th October. About TriForce Tokens Disrupting the gaming industry through blockchain, the decentralized gaming platform offers developers to connect directly with game players, creating a unique community where players can actually interact with the developers and discuss different aspects of games, such as new updates and releases. Through the direct contact of creator and consumer, the entire traditional distribution channels are eliminated, making games cheaper and having a higher retention rate. TriForce Tokens has already released a number of PC and mobile games, including Eximius, a combination of FPS and RTS game that pitches 5 men teams against each other for domination.

      "Big investors poured $81 million into cryptocurrency products offered by Grayscale Investments in the third quarter of 2018 and $330 million so far this year, according to a new report from the crypto asset manager. The figures reflect record levels of interest among institutional investors, and come as a piece of good news for the cryptocurrency market, which has been mired in a prolonged price slump since last December. Grayscale, which is a subsidiary of the crypto conglomerate Digital Currency Group, offers a series of funds dedicated to individual cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin and XRP. The funds sell the currencies in the form of shares in a trust, and provide a means for institutional investors, many of which are barred from buying cryptocurrency directly, with exposure to the market. The report suggests that, even as consumer interest in cryptocurrency has waned, demand is stronger than ever from the likes of pension funds and family offices. The $330 million figure is remarkable given that the total inflow into Grayscale’s products for the first three quarters of 2017 totaled $21 million. In 2016, the comparable figure was $17 million. While Grayscale has added new types of cryptocurrency in recent months, including a privacy-focused coin called Zen, Bitcoin remains by far its most popular asset choice, accounting for 73% of total inflows. Here’s a chart from the report showing cumulative investments: “These figures are evidence that interest has not dwindled as a result of prices decreasing. What we’ve witnessed is the strongest inflows we’ve ever experienced over 5 years from both existing investors and new investors,” said Michael Sonnenshein, managing director of Grayscale. Grayscale’s report is consistent with other recent findings, including an investment note this week from Morgan Stanley, which show strong institutional interest in cryptocurrencies: Still, as MS identifies, the retail market appears to be standing still while institutions wade in pic.twitter.com/x2UsrXhua0 — Frank Chaparro (@fintechfrank) November 1, 2018 Meanwhile, as Fortune reported in September, more than half of trading volume at exchange behemoth Coinbase, which made its name serving retail investors, now comes from professional traders and institutional investors. All of this suggests that institutional capital could serve as a stabilizing long term force for volatile cryptocurrency markets. According to Sonnenshein, large investors are attracted to the market in part because it provides a means to gain exposure to new protocols and technologies associated with blockchain.\n",

      "Twitter Facebook LinkedIn Tokens and several major cryptocurrencies such as EOS have demonstrated strong short-term momentum over the last 24 hours, pushing the valuation of the crypto market to $206 billion. The volume of Bitcoin, which declined to the mid-$3 billion region, recovered to $4.2 billion, showing a clear increase in trading activity across major cryptocurrency exchanges. Affected by the increase in the volume of Bitcoin, tokens and digital assets such as Loom, Status, Bancor, WaltonChain, Pundi X, OmiseGo, and Zcash recorded gains in the range of 8 to 20 percent, portraying large upside movements for the first time since September 15. What the Increase in the Volume of Bitcoin Means In previous reports, CCN reported that the low volume of Bitcoin has left the cryptocurrency market vulnerable to short-term drops, possibly below the $200 billion mark. At one point, the volume of Bitcoin fell to $3.1 billion, down nearly 26 percent from $4.2 billion. Technical analysts including Hsaka emphasized that the failure of Bitcoin to recover in volume could trigger the dominant cryptocurrency to maintain its tight range until the end of the year, which could prevent the initiation of 2019 with positive sentiment regarding cryptocurrencies as a growing asset class. “To be honest, with volume and volatility petering out, I wouldn’t be surprised to see BTC hold this range for another month (and maybe till the EOY too). Would be the path of maximum pain, bears don’t get their rapid selloff to 4.8k, bulls distraught over not being able to break 6.8k,” Hsaka explained. In early 2019, specifically in February, several major announcements await Bitcoin. Most importantly, the final deadline of the VanEck/SolidX Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) application is set to be evaluated by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) by the end of February 2019. If Bitcoin can initiate a major positive price movement prior to the year’s end impacted by the launch of BTC futures markets by Bakkt and Goldman Sachs, a positive sentiment could be carried out into the first quarter of 2019. A positive sentiment from 2018 combined with an approval of a Bitcoin ETF could have a drastic impact on the price of Bitcoin and the valuation of the cryptocurrency market that could potentially trigger a strong mid-term rally. Hence, in the short-term, at least by the end of November, it is important for BTC and the rest of the crypto market to demonstrate some momentum supported by decent volume to prevent the current negative sentiment in the global market being carried into next year. Risky Trades In general, the vast majority of tokens and small market cryptocurrencies have recorded 5 to 10 percent gains in the past 12 hours. ICON, Decentraland, Polymath, Tron, Aelf, Aion, and many other tokens that have poorly performed against both BTC and the US dollar have demonstrated strong short-term movements. It is possible that the increase in the volume of Bitcoin was triggered by bulls in the market trying to push the cryptocurrency market out of its low price range to defend the $6,000 support level and achieve minor resistance levels in the mid-$6,000 region for BTC.

CCN urges readers to conduct their own research with due diligence into the company, product or service mentioned in the press release. BitMax.io is a global operator of innovative digital asset trading platform with a broad range of products and services for global retail and institutional clients. With its relentless focus on transparency, reliability, and quality of execution and client services, BitMax.io has established itself as a clear leader in the crypto trading and exchange space. The project’s roadmap has numerous user-friendly features, trader-focused services, and investment-grade solutions that can be used by crypto enthusiasts of all types. One of these, an innovative mining solution, will be launched, and first phase public testing of mining activities will go live on the BitMax.io platform on November 1st, 12 am EST. About BitMax.io’s Mining Leveraging their quant trading background and deep knowledge of the capital market, the team is working on introducing the transaction-fee based “Trans-Fee Mining” model that would distribute back the transaction fees to traders in the form of the exchange’s own token. The more traders trade, the more tokens they will receive, hence the term “transaction mining.” Furthermore, the team introduces specific incentive structure for market maker trades, the type of trading behavior adding liquidity to the exchange. This development has the potential to revolutionize crypto trade and exchange. Trading on Traditional Exchanges Traditional exchanges charge different rates from both makers and takers for using their platform, with both parties being deducted anywhere between 0.2% and 0.05% or so for each trade executed. This means that the more you trade, the more you pay to the exchange in transaction fees. Many big exchanges have profited heavily by following such models, but BitMax.io is bringing about a paradigm shift by making it easier for investors and private individuals to benefit from crypto trade and investment. With the trans-fee-mining model, users can save transaction fees and get platform tokens simply by executing trades on the BitMax.io exchange, regardless of market conditions, volatility, or other external factors. How Trans-Fee-Mining Works In the trans-fee-mining model, the BitMax.io trading platform uses an innovative utility token called BTMX. Instead of deducting a fixed percentage from all trades as trading fees, BitMax.io instead credits makers and takers with an equal value of BTMX. In this way, BTMX is mined as an outcome of regular trading. This not only conserves mining energy but also incentivizes trading regardless of external factors by providing traders with a new token (BTMX) that has a rich secondary market and can be used for future trading and other activities. This is a huge positive factor for traders who execute trades in times of market volatility. Furthermore, BTMX can be traded with other cryptocurrencies based on available trading pairs or can be cashed out to the user’s BitMax.io wallet. Additional Mining Specs BitMax.io’s rules governing mining and the creation and distribution of tokens are designed to ensure fairness and transparency. These rules are as below. Types of Mining “Mining” is the process where the traders pay transaction fees at a certain level and receive a certain amount of BTMX as a trading reward. “Reverse-Mining” is a separate unique incentive structure for the Maker trades, the process of the platform paying transaction fee at certain rate in return for the equivalent market value of BTMX that the user holds in the account. “Regular Trading” is simply not opting for either Mining or Reverse-Mining and conducting regular trades on the platform. Rules for Makers and Takers A Taker is someone who places an order that is immediately filled fully or partially (for example, a market or stop order) before getting on the order book. A Maker is when a user places an order that doesn’t fill immediately partially or fully (such as a limit order) and sits on the order book waiting to be matched. Traders can select either Mining or Regular Trading mode for their Taker trades. For Maker trades, they can select one from Mining, Reverse-Mining, or Regular Trading mode. *Please note that additional details on fee calculations and mined token utilization will be published over the coming weeks. Mining Design Protocols This innovative new approach to mining and trading is built on a very comprehensive token creation and exchange operating framework that factors in all of the key elements of sound token economics design, including all of the following: Token production output control and target mining rate control to manage the sustainable rate of tokens being mined as part of the supply. Managing liquidity: the rule design including very innovative structure to encourage liquidity provision type trading behavior Profit-sharing/allocation mechanism: Since BTMX tokens constitute a new form of utility value on the BitMax.io, for those token holders who agree to share transaction data, there will be further platform fee distribution to encourage them to continue holding BTMX. Mandatory lock-up for large sale order: This is necessary to better balance the trading activities in the market and help supporting the value of tokens over longer periods of time. Consumption framework: The different ways that BTMX can be used on the platform as the only utility payment considered during the design of the new trans-fee-mining approach. With the launch of this new mining model, BitMax.io maintains its commitment to helping to build a stronger, more beneficial trading tools and services for the crypto community. With a large and growing user base, the trans-fee-mining initiative is sure to attract and bring in new users to the BitMax.io platform, and the company is working hard to provide quality trading services those new customers and market entrants over the weeks and months to come.

      "There’s a new form of cryptocurrency gaining traction among fans of digital cash. Unlike bitcoin, which has seen its price swing wildly from as high as $19,000 last year to its current level hovering around $6,200, this emerging class of cryptocurrency aims to maintain a stable price — one, single U.S. dollar — at all times. A cryptocurrency whose price never fluctuates might sound nonsensical, particularly to entry-level traders who want to profit off a cryptocurrency’s appreciation. But many in the industry say the rise of “stablecoins” has in fact been instrumental for active investors — and could represent a crucial steppingstone to the future of money. Bitcoin was hailed initially as a form of digital cash that could be used to purchase real-world goods and services. But in practice, the currency’s volatility has made buying anything with it far more complicated. In one early example from 2010, a programmer offered to pay for two pizzas with 10,000 bitcoin. At the time, that amounted to roughly $30. At today’s prices, it would be equivalent to $62 million. “I don’t know whether the price of that crypto is going to go up or down, but it’s almost certainly not going to be the same as it is today,” said Josh Fraser, co-founder of the cryptocurrency start-up Origin Protocol. “That introduces the problem [for] either the buyer or seller . . . as part of that transaction.” That’s why many in the industry now see stablecoins as a big opportunity that could fulfill much of bitcoin’s original promise as a medium of exchange. In recent months, dozens of stablecoin projects have been launched or announced. With names like TrueUSD, Paxos, Havven and Dai, this new crop of coins enjoys a combined market cap of more than $2.3 billion, according to CoinMarketCap, which tracks the price of hundreds of cryptocurrencies. In September, Gemini — the cryptocurrency exchange supported by the twin entrepreneurs Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss — announced the Gemini Dollar; earlier this month, the payments company Circle said its U.S. Dollar Coin would become available on Coinbase, one of America’s most prominent exchanges. “Stablecoins bring some of the early potential of crypto into view,” said Balaji Srinivasan, Coinbase’s chief technology officer, “and they make possible payments that are very small, very fast, very large, very international, very transparent and very automated.” Giving the U.S. dollar digital properties reflects the next stage of evolution for money, supporters say, because it takes the best attributes of a reserve currency — its reliability and universality — and combines them with the newfound technological capabilities of a cryptocurrency. It may not only enable faster payments that don’t involve banks or the clunky Automated Clearing House system, but could also allow for new kinds of financial apps and services that don’t depend on partnerships with banks to function. Entirely new economic relationships could arise in the form of digital economic contracts that enforce themselves. Although bitcoin offered the same promise, experts say, it has been held back by technical challenges, prompting entrepreneurs to look for new approaches. Many of the better-known stablecoins operate on a simple idea: Buyers pay a dollar to receive a digital token. The dollar is then held in reserve. If a buyer later decides to cash out, she can redeem her tokens for dollars at a one-to-one ratio. Buyers can also swap dollar-backed tokens for other cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin or ethereum, at various exchange rates. Certain other stablecoin projects seek to use algorithms to control the money supply by adding and deleting coins so that the trading price always stays at one dollar. The idea for a cryptocurrency that is all but identical to the dollar is not new. In 2014, a company named Tether launched a coin with a unique proposition: For every Tether in circulation, there would be one U.S. dollar to back it up. Tether fulfilled an important need in the investor community, experts say. At a time of volatility in the cryptocurrency markets, Tether’s stablecoin allowed investors to seek the relative safety of a dollar-like vehicle without actually cashing out of the cryptocurrency space entirely, which could lead to costly fees and delays. (The company did not respond to requests for an interview.) Tether proved wildly popular: By late August, its own market cap had hit $2.8 billion. But not all was well: In the past several weeks, Tether has been hit by a massive crisis of confidence. On some exchanges, Tether began trading at well below a dollar, which is not supposed to happen for a currency whose sole purpose is to maintain a solid peg. While the precise reasons for the slippage remain unclear, investors have engaged in a sell-off, and Bitfinex — a major exchange that shares the same management as Tether — took hundreds of millions of Tether coins out of circulation. In one month, Tether lost almost $1 billion in its market cap. Part of what’s driving the chaos is a long-standing suspicion among some Tether skeptics that the company lacks the dollars on hand to repay people should they seek to redeem their Tether tokens en masse. A related concern is that if there are more Tether tokens in circulation than there really ought to be, and the Tether is being traded for other cryptocurrencies, then perhaps those currencies prices could be overstated, resulting in possible distortions and uncertainty in the wider market. Tether has not succeeded in tamping down those fears; the company has steadfastly avoided opening its books for a professional audit, despite making claims that it is solvent. Although Tether is still the most dominant stablecoin, the chaos appears to be helping its rivals, according to an analysis by the publication CoinDesk, which noted an uptick in the market shares of TrueUSD and U.S. Dollar Coin in recent weeks. The secrecy and uncertainty surrounding Tether has encouraged many other entrepreneurs to build competing dollar-backed coins that have “more transparency” than Tether, Fraser said. Critics of stablecoins say they can’t work, because they ignore what economists have learned over hundreds of years. Preston Byrne, a cryptocurrency entrepreneur, has called stablecoins a “techno-magical idea,” particularly referring to the projects that rely on algorithms to control the money supply. Dictating the price of the currency and expecting the market to obey, rather than allowing the market to set a currency’s price, is backward, he has said. For a company to amass billions of dollars on the off chance it will have to pay it out all at once makes for an expensive business model that doesn’t scale, wrote Barry Eichengreen, a professor of economics at the University of California at Berkeley, in a recent op-ed. Holding just a fraction of the needed reserves isn’t much of a solution either, he added, because it could lead to disaster in the event of a run on the currency. “All of this will be familiar to anyone who has encountered even a single study on speculative attacks on pegged exchange rates, or to anyone who has had a coffee with an emerging-market central banker,” he wrote. Yet some of the cryptocurrency industry’s biggest players insist that soon we will see not just digital tokens backed by U.S. dollars, but also others mimicking the euro, the yen, the British pound and many others. “I don’t think in five years people will be calling them stablecoins,” said Jeremy Allaire, the chief executive of Circle. “It’ll just be ‘money on the Internet.’”\n"

      "There’s a new form of cryptocurrency gaining traction among fans of digital cash. Unlike bitcoin, which has seen its price swing wildly from as high as $19,000 last year to its current level hovering around $6,200, this emerging class of cryptocurrency aims to maintain a stable price — one, single U.S. dollar — at all times. A cryptocurrency whose price never fluctuates might sound nonsensical, particularly to entry-level traders who want to profit off a cryptocurrency’s appreciation. But many in the industry say the rise of “stablecoins” has in fact been instrumental for active investors — and could represent a crucial steppingstone to the future of money. Bitcoin was hailed initially as a form of digital cash that could be used to purchase real-world goods and services. But in practice, the currency’s volatility has made buying anything with it far more complicated. In one early example from 2010, a programmer offered to pay for two pizzas with 10,000 bitcoin. At the time, that amounted to roughly $30. At today’s prices, it would be equivalent to $62 million. “I don’t know whether the price of that crypto is going to go up or down, but it’s almost certainly not going to be the same as it is today,” said Josh Fraser, co-founder of the cryptocurrency start-up Origin Protocol. “That introduces the problem [for] either the buyer or seller . . . as part of that transaction.” That’s why many in the industry now see stablecoins as a big opportunity that could fulfill much of bitcoin’s original promise as a medium of exchange. In recent months, dozens of stablecoin projects have been launched or announced. With names like TrueUSD, Paxos, Havven and Dai, this new crop of coins enjoys a combined market cap of more than $2.3 billion, according to CoinMarketCap, which tracks the price of hundreds of cryptocurrencies. In September, Gemini — the cryptocurrency exchange supported by the twin entrepreneurs Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss — announced the Gemini Dollar; earlier this month, the payments company Circle said its U.S. Dollar Coin would become available on Coinbase, one of America’s most prominent exchanges. “Stablecoins bring some of the early potential of crypto into view,” said Balaji Srinivasan, Coinbase’s chief technology officer, “and they make possible payments that are very small, very fast, very large, very international, very transparent and very automated.” Giving the U.S. dollar digital properties reflects the next stage of evolution for money, supporters say, because it takes the best attributes of a reserve currency — its reliability and universality — and combines them with the newfound technological capabilities of a cryptocurrency. It may not only enable faster payments that don’t involve banks or the clunky Automated Clearing House system, but could also allow for new kinds of financial apps and services that don’t depend on partnerships with banks to function. Entirely new economic relationships could arise in the form of digital economic contracts that enforce themselves. Although bitcoin offered the same promise, experts say, it has been held back by technical challenges, prompting entrepreneurs to look for new approaches. Many of the better-known stablecoins operate on a simple idea: Buyers pay a dollar to receive a digital token. The dollar is then held in reserve. If a buyer later decides to cash out, she can redeem her tokens for dollars at a one-to-one ratio. Buyers can also swap dollar-backed tokens for other cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin or ethereum, at various exchange rates. Certain other stablecoin projects seek to use algorithms to control the money supply by adding and deleting coins so that the trading price always stays at one dollar. The idea for a cryptocurrency that is all but identical to the dollar is not new. In 2014, a company named Tether launched a coin with a unique proposition: For every Tether in circulation, there would be one U.S. dollar to back it up. Tether fulfilled an important need in the investor community, experts say. At a time of volatility in the cryptocurrency markets, Tether’s stablecoin allowed investors to seek the relative safety of a dollar-like vehicle without actually cashing out of the cryptocurrency space entirely, which could lead to costly fees and delays. (The company did not respond to requests for an interview.) Tether proved wildly popular: By late August, its own market cap had hit $2.8 billion. But not all was well: In the past several weeks, Tether has been hit by a massive crisis of confidence. On some exchanges, Tether began trading at well below a dollar, which is not supposed to happen for a currency whose sole purpose is to maintain a solid peg. While the precise reasons for the slippage remain unclear, investors have engaged in a sell-off, and Bitfinex — a major exchange that shares the same management as Tether — took hundreds of millions of Tether coins out of circulation. In one month, Tether lost almost $1 billion in its market cap. Part of what’s driving the chaos is a long-standing suspicion among some Tether skeptics that the company lacks the dollars on hand to repay people should they seek to redeem their Tether tokens en masse. A related concern is that if there are more Tether tokens in circulation than there really ought to be, and the Tether is being traded for other cryptocurrencies, then perhaps those currencies prices could be overstated, resulting in possible distortions and uncertainty in the wider market. Tether has not succeeded in tamping down those fears; the company has steadfastly avoided opening its books for a professional audit, despite making claims that it is solvent. Although Tether is still the most dominant stablecoin, the chaos appears to be helping its rivals, according to an analysis by the publication CoinDesk, which noted an uptick in the market shares of TrueUSD and U.S. Dollar Coin in recent weeks. The secrecy and uncertainty surrounding Tether has encouraged many other entrepreneurs to build competing dollar-backed coins that have “more transparency” than Tether, Fraser said. Critics of stablecoins say they can’t work, because they ignore what economists have learned over hundreds of years. Preston Byrne, a cryptocurrency entrepreneur, has called stablecoins a “techno-magical idea,” particularly referring to the projects that rely on algorithms to control the money supply. Dictating the price of the currency and expecting the market to obey, rather than allowing the market to set a currency’s price, is backward, he has said. For a company to amass billions of dollars on the off chance it will have to pay it out all at once makes for an expensive business model that doesn’t scale, wrote Barry Eichengreen, a professor of economics at the University of California at Berkeley, in a recent op-ed. Holding just a fraction of the needed reserves isn’t much of a solution either, he added, because it could lead to disaster in the event of a run on the currency. “All of this will be familiar to anyone who has encountered even a single study on speculative attacks on pegged exchange rates, or to anyone who has had a coffee with an emerging-market central banker,” he wrote. Yet some of the cryptocurrency industry’s biggest players insist that soon we will see not just digital tokens backed by U.S. dollars, but also others mimicking the euro, the yen, the British pound and many others. “I don’t think in five years people will be calling them stablecoins,” said Jeremy Allaire, the chief executive of Circle. “It’ll just be ‘money on the Internet.’”\n"

      "Twitter Facebook LinkedIn Tokens and several major cryptocurrencies such as EOS have demonstrated strong short-term momentum over the last 24 hours, pushing the valuation of the crypto market to $206 billion. The volume of Bitcoin, which declined to the mid-$3 billion region, recovered to $4.2 billion, showing a clear increase in trading activity across major cryptocurrency exchanges. Affected by the increase in the volume of Bitcoin, tokens and digital assets such as Loom, Status, Bancor, WaltonChain, Pundi X, OmiseGo, and Zcash recorded gains in the range of 8 to 20 percent, portraying large upside movements for the first time since September 15. What the Increase in the Volume of Bitcoin Means In previous reports, CCN reported that the low volume of Bitcoin has left the cryptocurrency market vulnerable to short-term drops, possibly below the $200 billion mark. At one point, the volume of Bitcoin fell to $3.1 billion, down nearly 26 percent from $4.2 billion. Technical analysts including Hsaka emphasized that the failure of Bitcoin to recover in volume could trigger the dominant cryptocurrency to maintain its tight range until the end of the year, which could prevent the initiation of 2019 with positive sentiment regarding cryptocurrencies as a growing asset class. “To be honest, with volume and volatility petering out, I wouldn’t be surprised to see BTC hold this range for another month (and maybe till the EOY too). Would be the path of maximum pain, bears don’t get their rapid selloff to 4.8k, bulls distraught over not being able to break 6.8k,” Hsaka explained. In early 2019, specifically in February, several major announcements await Bitcoin. Most importantly, the final deadline of the VanEck/SolidX Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) application is set to be evaluated by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) by the end of February 2019. If Bitcoin can initiate a major positive price movement prior to the year’s end impacted by the launch of BTC futures markets by Bakkt and Goldman Sachs, a positive sentiment could be carried out into the first quarter of 2019. A positive sentiment from 2018 combined with an approval of a Bitcoin ETF could have a drastic impact on the price of Bitcoin and the valuation of the cryptocurrency market that could potentially trigger a strong mid-term rally. Hence, in the short-term, at least by the end of November, it is important for BTC and the rest of the crypto market to demonstrate some momentum supported by decent volume to prevent the current negative sentiment in the global market being carried into next year. Risky Trades In general, the vast majority of tokens and small market cryptocurrencies have recorded 5 to 10 percent gains in the past 12 hours. ICON, Decentraland, Polymath, Tron, Aelf, Aion, and many other tokens that have poorly performed against both BTC and the US dollar have demonstrated strong short-term movements. It is possible that the increase in the volume of Bitcoin was triggered by bulls in the market trying to push the cryptocurrency market out of its low price range to defend the $6,000 support level and achieve minor resistance levels in the mid-$6,000 region for BTC.

      "Hong Kong is taking steps to provide a friendlier environment for cryptocurrencies, with a proposal for a regulatory \"sandbox\" — a space for startups to experiment and innovate without costly, sometimes crippling, regulation. The move resembles two-year-old UK program that Britains regulators have hailed as a success, and is perhaps plays a part in the UKs dominance as a global fintech hub. At the time of the UK sandbox debut, the countrys Financial Conduct Authority said the purpose was to provide firms with: The ability to test products and services in a controlled environment; Reduced time-to-market at potentially lower cost; Support in identifying appropriate consumer protection safeguards to build into new products and services; Better access to finance; Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission chief Ashley Alder floated the plan on Thursday, according to Reuters. Its a shift in stance after the Asian financial hubs regulator in February said it would crack down on cryptocurrency exchanges that operate without a license or violate local securities laws. Hong Kong can look to the UK for inspiration. This year, the FCA took its sandbox idea a step further, starting a sandbox especially for the fintech industry after the success of the 2016 program. FCA board member and Director of Strategy and Competition Christopher Woolard said in March that the agency has worked with some 500 firms, of which 70 has been in depth via the fintech sandbox, according to Trustnodes. He said he saw an \"aspiration for global standards\" in terms of regulations. Some 90% of the companies that participated in the first round of applications for the UK sandbox, including Blockchain companies and startups, have \"gone on to market,\" while many firms also find it easier to get access to funding, Woolard said. In February of this year, the FCA granted a London-based blockchain startup a Small Electronic Money Institution (EMI) registration, allowing it to create a blockchain-based currency within the existing regulatory framework, Cointelegraph reported. The FCA in March gave crypto exchange and wallet Coinbase an e-money license, allowing Coinbase to issue e-money and provide payment services in the UK, Cointelegraph said. Charlotte Crosswell, CEO of Innovate Finance, said it is important to dispel the myth of regulation being a hurdle for young firms to overcome, according to Crowdfund Insider. She said earlier this year: \"Regulators can, on the contrary, play an active and positive role in encouraging innovation by giving unique business models permission to play in the highly competitive financial services sector.\"\n",

      "Twitter Facebook LinkedIn Intrigue abounds around the allegedly Singapore-based WEX exchange, whose ownership and activities have both been called into question in recent months. Particularly of interest was the exchange listing a much higher market price for BTC and weirdly overcharging for USDT. CCN previously gave our readers an overly interesting report on the exchange in which writer Conor Maloney explained: WEX is a rebranded version of the BTC-e exchange which was shut down in connection to a multi-billion dollar money laundering operation with a Russian national named Alexander Vinnik reportedly charged in connection with the criminal operation. Singapore business records indicate that the exchange is officially owned by one Dmitry Vasiliev, but he recently claimed to have lost control of the exchange and was unable to clarify exactly who was in charge. RBK reports that a former Soviet militiaman called Dmitry Khavchenko was plannning on buying the exchange – Khavchenko is a Ukranian militia member with the callsign ‘Sailor’ and fought in Crimea to support the Russian annexation in 2014, seen in this video armed with a machine gun handing over to authorities the flight recorders from the Malaysian Flight 17 jet that was shot down over Ukraine in 2014 killing 283 passengers and 15 crew. Binance Freezes WEX Accounts Caught Moving Customer Funds According to reporting in the cryptomedia and the CEO of Binance himself, WEX has been caught moving millions of dollars in cryptos from its exchange through the largest exchange by volume, and Binance has in turn frozen the accounts and requested the public to contact law enforcement agencies. the identified accounts are frozen, please report to law enforcement and have a case number. We will work with LE. This is part of centralization we hate too, dealing with other exchanges mess (we dont even know the details). But we will do what we can. https://t.co/tgyYI5ptqx — CZ Binance (@cz_binance) October 30, 2018 WEX has previously frozen withdrawals and it seems likely that the problems on the exchange continue. Previous to its negative coverage regarding the withdrawal problems and its strange prices, WEX was an unknown quantity. Frequently people run into trouble when dealing with small, unknown exchanges, leading experts to advise that people stick with large-scale, regulated, known exchanges in all cases. The high price of BTC on the exchange continues today and the exchange has not tweeted since August. Several clients of WEX have complained loudly on Twitter and elsewhere regarding the lack of withdrawals. hi @cz_binance if @WEXnz is included this situation pls do not unfreeze the account until they let the withdraws… @WEXnz is one of the the biggest fraud of crypto — gambinocrypto (@gambinocrypto) October 30, 2018 An unofficial Reddit page is filled with complaints, and one user has decided to take legal action in the form of a class action suit. Users also have perhaps unrealistic hopes that the Binance account freezing will result in Binance honoring the funds of WEX users – something that would be highly unusual. What Binance can do, however, is comply with law enforcement and ultimately return funds to users in that manner. The news of Binance freezing the funds of WEX officials comes on the heels of a meltdown at MapleChange which resulted in tens of thousands of dollars in cryptocurrencies being lost. The episodes reinforce expert advice that the use of small and unregulated exchanges, even if it appears one will make a great deal in arbitrage, is probably best avoided.

      "Twitter Facebook LinkedIn The Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) released a statement today stipulating the regulatory standards that would define the trajectory of virtual assets portfolio managers and fund distributors, according to an announcement on its website. As per CCN’s report, the regulator had proposed the framework in a research paper published in October 2018. The reforms became imperative following the leverage inherent in possessing virtual assets via funds and the seeming awareness of investors about the presence of unlicensed trading operators in Hong Kong. In view of this trend, the SFC is also exploring conceptual frameworks to come up with regulations that will be binding on virtual asset trading platform operators. Securities regulators are on the same page on the investor protection risks posed by virtual assets. The statement from the SFC reads in part: “While virtual assets have not posed a material risk to financial stability, there is a broad consensus among securities regulators that they pose significant investor protection risks. The regulatory response to these risks varies in different jurisdictions, depending on the regulatory remit, the scale of the activities and their impact on investor interests and whether virtual assets are deemed financial products suitable for regulation.” There has been a variance in the regulatory response to these risks across different jurisdictions. Under the existing regulatory remits in Hong Kong, the legal definition of “securities” or “future contracts” puts a tentative mark on the ability of the SFC to exercise its oversight functions on all virtual assets. Thus, investors who have resorted to trading cryptocurrencies through unregulated trading platforms are vulnerable. Associated Risks Virtual assets generally lack an intrinsic value which makes them extremely volatile. Unlike fiat currencies which are known to have generally accepted valuation principles, virtual assets’ prices are driven by supply and demand and in most cases by the Fear of Missing Out (FOMO) and Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt (FUD), which magnifies its volatility. The lack of acceptable standards in obtaining evidence for the existence and ownership of virtual assets makes it relatively impossible to ascertain the reasonableness of the valuations. The anonymity of these assets has made them tools for perpetrating unscrupulous activities such as money laundering, terrorist financing, and fraud. New Regulatory Reforms The new regulatory stance of the SFC puts a significant portion of all virtual assets under the definition of “securities” or “futures contracts.” In addition to the latest framework, “ firms managing funds which solely invest in virtual assets that do not constitute securities or future contracts” will be required to acquire a license for dealing in securities as well as the distribution of these funds in Hong Kong. The scope of supervision will also cover firms which are licensed or might require a license for managing portfolios in securities, futures contracts or both. Featured image from Shutterstock.\n",

Bitcoin Press Release: Decentralized gaming platform TriForce Tokens, continues to disrupt the online gaming industry, focusing on the Latin American market with a recent partnership with Busca Todo. October 30, 2018, Milton Keynes – Disrupting the global gaming market with its innovative blockchain solutions, TriForce Tokens has made significant impacts on the industry. Not satisfied to limit its ambitions to limited markets, the UK-based gaming platform has made substantial efforts to break into the Latin American market, with a huge partnership with Busca Todo. The partnership was followed recently with the launch of the first ever blockchain-back Steam game, Eximius: Seize the Frontline. The TriForce Tokens is currently in the final stage of its token sale, which finishes on the 11th of November, 2018. Booming Market The Latin American gaming sector is the second largest in the world. In 2017 alone, the industry made USD 4.1 billion, with Mexico leading the way with USD 1.4 billion. The market is growing rapidly, thanks to the efforts of the government’s early on in the 2000s to encourage digital gaming development. Prime examples of the efforts are the 5% of GDP dedicated to the industry by Mexico and state-owned Ingenio Uruguay’s incubator releasing successful games such as 1811 and D.E.D. Busca Todo’s and Level-Up Busca Todo is the leading video game publisher in the Latin American market. The organization’s main aim is to boost the Spanish speaking industry by offering them a platform to not only launch but also advertise, raise funding and reaching out to millions of gamers worldwide. The partnership with Busca Todo gives the TriForce Tokens the perfect launch pad to enter the South American Market. Busca Todo’s Level-Up is the leading online gaming community in the Latin American market. With the platform having a global subscriber base for game reviews, shows, discussion, social networking, and the YouTube Level Up channel crossing the 1 million viewership mark, it brings a huge penetration for TriForce Tokens in the market. Speaking about the partnership, Pete Mardell, CEO of TriForce Tokens said: “We are fortunate to have found a partner that shares our vision and has the capacity to deliver on it with us, while providing us a strategic link to the largest emerging games industry region, Latin America” TriForce Tokens, for its part, will enable the market to increase the interaction of gamers and developers, substantially reduce distribution costs, combat piracy, offers cross-platform compatibility, in-game wealth retention and offer an increased level of interaction for the gaming community. Juan Pablo Rodriguez as the General Director stated: “speaking of the present and the future of gaming, Triforce is the vision that pushes for innovation in the industry. We are very proud to partner with Triforce making history every step of the way, by introducing new technology to the Latin American video gaming market” A Force to Reckon With TriForce Tokens has created an immense following and is rapidly expanding its ecosystem. The successful launch of Eximius: Seize the Frontline, a hybrid FPS and RTS domination game on Steam leads the way. The game is already attracting huge crowds. With the Halloween festivities just around the corner, the game developers have released a thematic special event for the game. TriForce Tokens is also developing a discord marketplace and game, along with a Twitch Streamer live bot. The sale of the platform’s FORCE tokens is in its final offering. That will end on 11th of November. Currently, the FORCE is available for USD 0.15 per token and carries a 5% bonus until 28th October.

      "Big investors poured $81 million into cryptocurrency products offered by Grayscale Investments in the third quarter of 2018 and $330 million so far this year, according to a new report from the crypto asset manager. The figures reflect record levels of interest among institutional investors, and come as a piece of good news for the cryptocurrency market, which has been mired in a prolonged price slump since last December. Grayscale, which is a subsidiary of the crypto conglomerate Digital Currency Group, offers a series of funds dedicated to individual cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin and XRP. The funds sell the currencies in the form of shares in a trust, and provide a means for institutional investors, many of which are barred from buying cryptocurrency directly, with exposure to the market. The report suggests that, even as consumer interest in cryptocurrency has waned, demand is stronger than ever from the likes of pension funds and family offices. The $330 million figure is remarkable given that the total inflow into Grayscale’s products for the first three quarters of 2017 totaled $21 million. In 2016, the comparable figure was $17 million. While Grayscale has added new types of cryptocurrency in recent months, including a privacy-focused coin called Zen, Bitcoin remains by far its most popular asset choice, accounting for 73% of total inflows. Here’s a chart from the report showing cumulative investments: “These figures are evidence that interest has not dwindled as a result of prices decreasing. What we’ve witnessed is the strongest inflows we’ve ever experienced over 5 years from both existing investors and new investors,” said Michael Sonnenshein, managing director of Grayscale. Grayscale’s report is consistent with other recent findings, including an investment note this week from Morgan Stanley, which show strong institutional interest in cryptocurrencies: Still, as MS identifies, the retail market appears to be standing still while institutions wade in pic.twitter.com/x2UsrXhua0 — Frank Chaparro (@fintechfrank) November 1, 2018 Meanwhile, as Fortune reported in September, more than half of trading volume at exchange behemoth Coinbase, which made its name serving retail investors, now comes from professional traders and institutional investors. All of this suggests that institutional capital could serve as a stabilizing long term force for volatile cryptocurrency markets. According to Sonnenshein, large investors are attracted to the market in part because it provides a means to gain exposure to new protocols and technologies associated with blockchain.\n",

CCN urges readers to conduct their own research with due diligence into the company, product or service mentioned in the press release. BitMax.io is a global operator of innovative digital asset trading platform with a broad range of products and services for global retail and institutional clients. With its relentless focus on transparency, reliability, and quality of execution and client services, BitMax.io has established itself as a clear leader in the crypto trading and exchange space. The project’s roadmap has numerous user-friendly features, trader-focused services, and investment-grade solutions that can be used by crypto enthusiasts of all types. One of these, an innovative mining solution, will be launched, and first phase public testing of mining activities will go live on the BitMax.io platform on November 1st, 12 am EST. About BitMax.io’s Mining Leveraging their quant trading background and deep knowledge of the capital market, the team is working on introducing the transaction-fee based “Trans-Fee Mining” model that would distribute back the transaction fees to traders in the form of the exchange’s own token. The more traders trade, the more tokens they will receive, hence the term “transaction mining.” Furthermore, the team introduces specific incentive structure for market maker trades, the type of trading behavior adding liquidity to the exchange. This development has the potential to revolutionize crypto trade and exchange. Trading on Traditional Exchanges Traditional exchanges charge different rates from both makers and takers for using their platform, with both parties being deducted anywhere between 0.2% and 0.05% or so for each trade executed. This means that the more you trade, the more you pay to the exchange in transaction fees. Many big exchanges have profited heavily by following such models, but BitMax.io is bringing about a paradigm shift by making it easier for investors and private individuals to benefit from crypto trade and investment. With the trans-fee-mining model, users can save transaction fees and get platform tokens simply by executing trades on the BitMax.io exchange, regardless of market conditions, volatility, or other external factors. How Trans-Fee-Mining Works In the trans-fee-mining model, the BitMax.io trading platform uses an innovative utility token called BTMX. Instead of deducting a fixed percentage from all trades as trading fees, BitMax.io instead credits makers and takers with an equal value of BTMX. In this way, BTMX is mined as an outcome of regular trading. This not only conserves mining energy but also incentivizes trading regardless of external factors by providing traders with a new token (BTMX) that has a rich secondary market and can be used for future trading and other activities. This is a huge positive factor for traders who execute trades in times of market volatility. Furthermore, BTMX can be traded with other cryptocurrencies based on available trading pairs or can be cashed out to the user’s BitMax.io wallet. Additional Mining Specs BitMax.io’s rules governing mining and the creation and distribution of tokens are designed to ensure fairness and transparency. These rules are as below. Types of Mining “Mining” is the process where the traders pay transaction fees at a certain level and receive a certain amount of BTMX as a trading reward. “Reverse-Mining” is a separate unique incentive structure for the Maker trades, the process of the platform paying transaction fee at certain rate in return for the equivalent market value of BTMX that the user holds in the account. “Regular Trading” is simply not opting for either Mining or Reverse-Mining and conducting regular trades on the platform. Rules for Makers and Takers A Taker is someone who places an order that is immediately filled fully or partially (for example, a market or stop order) before getting on the order book. A Maker is when a user places an order that doesn’t fill immediately partially or fully (such as a limit order) and sits on the order book waiting to be matched. Traders can select either Mining or Regular Trading mode for their Taker trades. For Maker trades, they can select one from Mining, Reverse-Mining, or Regular Trading mode. *Please note that additional details on fee calculations and mined token utilization will be published over the coming weeks. Mining Design Protocols This innovative new approach to mining and trading is built on a very comprehensive token creation and exchange operating framework that factors in all of the key elements of sound token economics design, including all of the following: Token production output control and target mining rate control to manage the sustainable rate of tokens being mined as part of the supply. Managing liquidity: the rule design including very innovative structure to encourage liquidity provision type trading behavior Profit-sharing/allocation mechanism: Since BTMX tokens constitute a new form of utility value on the BitMax.io, for those token holders who agree to share transaction data, there will be further platform fee distribution to encourage them to continue holding BTMX. Mandatory lock-up for large sale order: This is necessary to better balance the trading activities in the market and help supporting the value of tokens over longer periods of time. Consumption framework: The different ways that BTMX can be used on the platform as the only utility payment considered during the design of the new trans-fee-mining approach. With the launch of this new mining model, BitMax.io maintains its commitment to helping to build a stronger, more beneficial trading tools and services for the crypto community. With a large and growing user base, the trans-fee-mining initiative is sure to attract and bring in new users to the BitMax.io platform, and the company is working hard to provide quality trading services those new customers and market entrants over the weeks and months to come.

      "There’s a new form of cryptocurrency gaining traction among fans of digital cash. Unlike bitcoin, which has seen its price swing wildly from as high as $19,000 last year to its current level hovering around $6,200, this emerging class of cryptocurrency aims to maintain a stable price — one, single U.S. dollar — at all times. A cryptocurrency whose price never fluctuates might sound nonsensical, particularly to entry-level traders who want to profit off a cryptocurrency’s appreciation. But many in the industry say the rise of “stablecoins” has in fact been instrumental for active investors — and could represent a crucial steppingstone to the future of money. Bitcoin was hailed initially as a form of digital cash that could be used to purchase real-world goods and services. But in practice, the currency’s volatility has made buying anything with it far more complicated. In one early example from 2010, a programmer offered to pay for two pizzas with 10,000 bitcoin. At the time, that amounted to roughly $30. At today’s prices, it would be equivalent to $62 million. “I don’t know whether the price of that crypto is going to go up or down, but it’s almost certainly not going to be the same as it is today,” said Josh Fraser, co-founder of the cryptocurrency start-up Origin Protocol. “That introduces the problem [for] either the buyer or seller . . . as part of that transaction.” That’s why many in the industry now see stablecoins as a big opportunity that could fulfill much of bitcoin’s original promise as a medium of exchange. In recent months, dozens of stablecoin projects have been launched or announced. With names like TrueUSD, Paxos, Havven and Dai, this new crop of coins enjoys a combined market cap of more than $2.3 billion, according to CoinMarketCap, which tracks the price of hundreds of cryptocurrencies. In September, Gemini — the cryptocurrency exchange supported by the twin entrepreneurs Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss — announced the Gemini Dollar; earlier this month, the payments company Circle said its U.S. Dollar Coin would become available on Coinbase, one of America’s most prominent exchanges. “Stablecoins bring some of the early potential of crypto into view,” said Balaji Srinivasan, Coinbase’s chief technology officer, “and they make possible payments that are very small, very fast, very large, very international, very transparent and very automated.” Giving the U.S. dollar digital properties reflects the next stage of evolution for money, supporters say, because it takes the best attributes of a reserve currency — its reliability and universality — and combines them with the newfound technological capabilities of a cryptocurrency. It may not only enable faster payments that don’t involve banks or the clunky Automated Clearing House system, but could also allow for new kinds of financial apps and services that don’t depend on partnerships with banks to function. Entirely new economic relationships could arise in the form of digital economic contracts that enforce themselves. Although bitcoin offered the same promise, experts say, it has been held back by technical challenges, prompting entrepreneurs to look for new approaches. Many of the better-known stablecoins operate on a simple idea: Buyers pay a dollar to receive a digital token. The dollar is then held in reserve. If a buyer later decides to cash out, she can redeem her tokens for dollars at a one-to-one ratio. Buyers can also swap dollar-backed tokens for other cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin or ethereum, at various exchange rates. Certain other stablecoin projects seek to use algorithms to control the money supply by adding and deleting coins so that the trading price always stays at one dollar. The idea for a cryptocurrency that is all but identical to the dollar is not new. In 2014, a company named Tether launched a coin with a unique proposition: For every Tether in circulation, there would be one U.S. dollar to back it up. Tether fulfilled an important need in the investor community, experts say. At a time of volatility in the cryptocurrency markets, Tether’s stablecoin allowed investors to seek the relative safety of a dollar-like vehicle without actually cashing out of the cryptocurrency space entirely, which could lead to costly fees and delays. (The company did not respond to requests for an interview.) Tether proved wildly popular: By late August, its own market cap had hit $2.8 billion. But not all was well: In the past several weeks, Tether has been hit by a massive crisis of confidence. On some exchanges, Tether began trading at well below a dollar, which is not supposed to happen for a currency whose sole purpose is to maintain a solid peg. While the precise reasons for the slippage remain unclear, investors have engaged in a sell-off, and Bitfinex — a major exchange that shares the same management as Tether — took hundreds of millions of Tether coins out of circulation. In one month, Tether lost almost $1 billion in its market cap. Part of what’s driving the chaos is a long-standing suspicion among some Tether skeptics that the company lacks the dollars on hand to repay people should they seek to redeem their Tether tokens en masse. A related concern is that if there are more Tether tokens in circulation than there really ought to be, and the Tether is being traded for other cryptocurrencies, then perhaps those currencies prices could be overstated, resulting in possible distortions and uncertainty in the wider market. Tether has not succeeded in tamping down those fears; the company has steadfastly avoided opening its books for a professional audit, despite making claims that it is solvent. Although Tether is still the most dominant stablecoin, the chaos appears to be helping its rivals, according to an analysis by the publication CoinDesk, which noted an uptick in the market shares of TrueUSD and U.S. Dollar Coin in recent weeks. The secrecy and uncertainty surrounding Tether has encouraged many other entrepreneurs to build competing dollar-backed coins that have “more transparency” than Tether, Fraser said. Critics of stablecoins say they can’t work, because they ignore what economists have learned over hundreds of years. Preston Byrne, a cryptocurrency entrepreneur, has called stablecoins a “techno-magical idea,” particularly referring to the projects that rely on algorithms to control the money supply. Dictating the price of the currency and expecting the market to obey, rather than allowing the market to set a currency’s price, is backward, he has said. For a company to amass billions of dollars on the off chance it will have to pay it out all at once makes for an expensive business model that doesn’t scale, wrote Barry Eichengreen, a professor of economics at the University of California at Berkeley, in a recent op-ed. Holding just a fraction of the needed reserves isn’t much of a solution either, he added, because it could lead to disaster in the event of a run on the currency. “All of this will be familiar to anyone who has encountered even a single study on speculative attacks on pegged exchange rates, or to anyone who has had a coffee with an emerging-market central banker,” he wrote. Yet some of the cryptocurrency industry’s biggest players insist that soon we will see not just digital tokens backed by U.S. dollars, but also others mimicking the euro, the yen, the British pound and many others. “I don’t think in five years people will be calling them stablecoins,” said Jeremy Allaire, the chief executive of Circle. “It’ll just be ‘money on the Internet.’”\n"

    "test = \"The race to build the best public blockchain will be won by those that would scale in line with volume. On a Sunday, a blockchain project realistically did it, though for 24 hours. Waves Platform, comprising of a digital ledger project and decentralized exchange (DEX), processed 6.1 million real-time transactions in a stress test. As it found, the network faced no disruptions or delays as the test intensified. None of the transactions on its system – undertaken by users for DEX orders, transfers, token creation, etc. – experienced any slowdown, either. The Waves blockchain, according to data provided by PYWAVES, recorded a total of 108,741 transactions. Among them, 60,933 were Mass Transfers which, per Waves blog post, are specialized transactions that can hold 100 transfer at once. “A total of 6,141,108 transfers was processed by the network, with the blockchain supporting hundreds of transactions per second at peak times,” the post claimed. The platform euphorically claimed that it was the highest number of transactions ever processed by any public blockchain. Waves NG Several blockchain projects in the crypto space are attempting to find alternatives to Bitcoin’s slow transaction confirmation periods. Ethereum was posed as a solution. But, it faced the same problem CryptoKitties – a decentralized application launched on Ethereum’s blockchain – slowed down transactions on the network. While Bitcoin has opted for third-party solutions like Lightning Network to handle the volume [temporarily], Ethereum is following a test-and-implement approach by taking in answers from its community developers. Waves, to achieve a similar goal, have implemented a tech called Waves NG that helps to scale the Waves Network by selecting miners in advance, thus minimizing latency and maximizing throughput. According to Waves’ CEO and co-founder Sasha Ivanov, the protocol’s deployment on their blockchain helped them process the record transactions. “Bitcoin processes just a few transactions per second,” he said. “Ethereum’s capacity is into double-digit tps, and a handful of other blockchains have improved on this incrementally in various ways. WAVES has implemented tech that enables a step-change in transaction volumes — not just in the lab, but in the real world, on MainNet, as these figures prove beyond doubt.” The Waves post noted that other blockchain projects had not exceeded more than 2 million transactions per day. However, a tweet from Ivanov admitted that EOS, a semi-decentralized blockchain project, had in fact executed 5 million transactions within a 24-hour period. EOS had 5.5 mil at most. — Sasha Ivanov (@sasha35625) October 23, 2018 A commentator also posted a chart from Blocktivity that suggested Waves was behind five blockchain projects concerning transaction volume. The chart later earned the “bogus” status from one of the Waves followers. Featured image from Shutterstock.\"\n"
