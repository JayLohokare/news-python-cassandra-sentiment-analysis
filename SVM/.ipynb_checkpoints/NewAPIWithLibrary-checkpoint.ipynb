      "Cybersecurity company Recorded Future has released a lengthy expose claiming that North Korea uses cryptocurrency to skirt U.S.-imposed economic sanctions alongside a shady network of collaborators and enablers in Singapore. The company claims that in addition to mining coins like bitcoin and monero, North Korean leaders have also been involved in promoting cryptocurrency scams that have bilked investors around the world of millions of dollars. North Korea’s Technology-Backed Evasion of Sanctions North Korea’s use of cutting edge technology to get around the effects of economic sanctions imposed on Kim Jong Un’s regime is well documented. In September, CCN reported that Washington-based financial experts Lourdes Miranda and Ross Delston accused North Korea of using crypto mining and coin scams as means of generating revenue. Earlier this month, CCN also reported that a notorious North Korean hacker group called “Lazarus” is responsible for the theft of more than $571 million in cryptocurrency. The Recorded Future report claims that North Korean leaders mine bitcoin and monero at a relatively small scale, with the bulk of their efforts in the cryptocurrency space from the first quarter of 2018 to date now focused on exploiting growing worldwide crypto awareness for the purpose of launching investment scams. Two coins in particular are identified as North Korean scam projects, namely HOLD coin and Marine Chain. HOLD Coin, also previously known as Interstellar, HUZU and Stellar (not to be confused with XLM) used a fraudulent staking scheme to collect investor money, having been variously listed and delisted across a number of exchanges before disappearing with all funds. Marine Chain on the other hand, was part of a more sophisticated scam that runs right to the heart of the North Korean government’s ability to consistently diminish the effectiveness of UN-imposed economic sanctions that would ordinarily cripple the regime. Billed as a tokenisation framework for maritime vessels, an investigation by Recorded Future into Marine Chain revealed a complex network linked to Singapore with potentially far-reaching implications for cybersecurity in Southeast Asia. The Singaporean Connection According to information gleaned from LinkedIn, an advisor called HyoMong Choi and the CEO of Marine Chain, Captain Jonathan Foong Kah Keong are the key figres in Marince Chain’s fradulent activities. Capt. Foong reportedly has connections to Singaporean companies that facilitate North Korean activities designed to circumvent U.N. sanctions. Activities these companies have been involved in include manipulating flag registries for three countries to give prohibited North Korean vessels the ability to sail under flags of convenience. This means that more than just being a run-of-the-mill cryptocurrency scammer, Capt. Foong is actually part of the key strategy employed by the North Korean regime to skirt sanctions that should ordinarily make it the most isolated regime on earth, and keep itself in power. The appearance of Capt. Foong in the context of North Korean crypto scams is significant of a wider pivot in the regime’s criminal activities as it looks to harness the possibilities presented by a new wave of technology including blockchain technology.

      "The Financial Services and Markets Authority (FSMA) has added 21 new websites of suspected cryptocurrency scams to its blacklist. Belgium’s financial regulator published the list on its official website, bringing their tally of suspected crypto scams in the country to 99. The agency found that despite their prior warnings concerning the risks associated with crypto investments, Belgium is witnessing a growth in online fraud cases. Among the blacklisted companies, many are offering financial services without complying with the Belgian financial legislation. Moreover, the listed firms are also involved in attracting victims to their allegedly fake investment schemes. The FSMA blacklist also names websites that reach out to the victims of earlier crypto frauds. These persons running these websites pose themselves as financial advisors, lawyers, and accountants. They promise victims that they would arrange compensation or to recover their losses in exchange for a fee. The financial contribution by the victim, however, does not result into anything substantial. The FSMA refer these scam websites as ‘Recovery Rooms.’ Outside Belgium Jurisdiction The blacklisted firms cannot be charged in Belgium for falling outside the jurisdiction of FSMA, the details revealed. Agence Des Analystes Financiers, for instance, is one of the denounced companies in the list but is reportedly based in Germany. Another firm BK-COIN appears to have offices in cities all across the world, including London, Tokyo, Meyrin, and Paris, the validity of which remains unconfirmed. Similarly, firms mentioned in the FSMA blacklist are appearing to operate from all around the globe but Belgium. Nevertheless, the agency has requested investors always to verify the companies with the concerned regulatory agencies. The advisory specified that FSMA couldn’t charge websites active in the cryptocurrency space in the absence of legal supervision, but an alert could still minimize the risks. “Be wary as well of companies that claim to hold authorizations from supervisory authorities and refer you to such authorizations,” the regulator wrote. “This is a very frequently used technique. However, these are often cases of identity theft. Feel free to ask the FSMA to confirm the information you have received.” Identifying a Swindler The FSMA advisory laid out the typical characteristics of an online crypto scam. The regulator said that swindlers usually contact victims by phone in a process called cold calling. They try to offer them a variety of investment options claiming they could yield maximum profits in a minimum span. They attempt to influence a victim into purchasing security tokens of a newly-launched blockchain product or participate in a multi-marketing scheme by investing cryptocurrencies. Regardless of the type of marketing pitch, the promises of a scammer include: high monthly or annual returns high liquidity (users can withdraw funds anytime they want) investments are protected by real-world collateral (it won’t fall below the value at which investments were made, even during a market crash) “All these promises are worthless, however: if an offer is fraudulent, the promises that accompany it are equally so,” the FSMA added.

      "As reported by CnLedger, a trusted cryptocurrency news source in China, the country’s merchants can legally accept crypto as a payment method. According to local reports, the Shenzhen Court of International Arbitration officially recognized Bitcoin as a property, allowing individuals and businesses to own and transfer Bitcoin without being in conflict with existing financial regulations. “Chinese court confirms Bitcoin is protected by law. Shenzhen Court of International Arbitration ruled a case involving cryptos. Inside the verdict: CN law does not forbid owning & transferring bitcoin, which should be protected by law because ofits property nature and economic value.” Circulation and the Payment of Bitcoin in China is Not Illegal Katherine Wu, a cryptocurrency researcher at Messari, translated and analyzed court documents released by the Shenzhen Court of International Arbitration to delve into the reasoning behind the decision of the arbitrator to consider Bitcoin as a property. In essence, Wu explained that due to the decentralized nature of Bitcoin that provides financial freedom and economic value to the owner, the asset can be recognized as a property. “The Party contends that Bitcoin has characteristics of a property (SOV), can be controlled by the owner, and has economic value to the owner. It does not break any laws. This arbitrator agrees,” Wu said. As such, the court emphasized that regardless of the legality of Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies, the circulation and payment of Bitcoin is not illegal. That means, merchants can freely accept cryptocurrencies as a payment method without breaking the local law. “In the arbitrator’s view, whether or not bitcoin is legal, the circulation and the payment of bitcoin is not illegal. Bitcoin does not have the same rights as fiat, but that does not mean that holding or paying with crypto is illegal.” Earlier this month, China’s oldest technology publication Beijing Sci-Tech Report (BSTR), a respected media company in the country, released its plans to accept Bitcoin for its yearly subscription to promote the usage of the blockchain and practical use cases of the dominant cryptocurrency. BSTR revealed that starting 2019, the yearly subscription to its magazine will be sold at a price of 0.01 BTC, worth around $65. If the price of BTC rises substantially in the future, the publication stated that it will compensate its customers. Several hotels in major cities in China have also started to accept cryptocurrencies, one of which branded itself as Ethereum Hotel, providing merits and discounts to those that pay for their services using Ethereum. What Does This Show About China? In consideration of China’s optimistic stance towards blockchain technology and positive comments regarding the sector made by government agencies, it has become more apparent that the government placed a blanket ban on cryptocurrency trading to prevent the devaluation of the Chinese yuan and to limit speculation in the market. But, overall, the government remains open to crypto and the usage of the blockchain to improve existing infrastructures and problems pertaining to software and data settlement.

CCN does not endorse, nor is responsible for any material included below and isn’t responsible for any damages or losses connected with any products or services mentioned in the press release. CCN urges readers to conduct their own research with due diligence into the company, product or service mentioned in the press release. October 24th, 2018 – Beijing/Seoul — TTC Protocol has announced new dAPP partnerships with four key vertical social platforms in South Korea. TTC Protocol is one of the largest social networking ecosystems on the blockchain with over 30m users spanning multiple dAPP partnerships. As a decentralized, incentive-based social networking protocol, TTC Protocol provides a one-step solution for integrating blockchain technology with a stable, vibrant ecosystem that provides value to all participants including developers, users, and third-party advertisers. Through new partnerships with the following platforms, TTC Protocol is adding 7.5m users to its existing user base: Pikicast – A popular content platform for millennials in South Korea Pikicast is one of South Korea’s most popular mobile content platforms, with over 19m downloads. Every month, millions of millennials use Pikicast to view the latest trendy video, text, picture, and webtoon content. SocDoc – South Korea’s #1 anonymous mobile community for women SocDoc is South Korea’s #1 mobile community for women, where users use anonymous IDs to share their daily thoughts on relationships, fashion, and makeup tips. It is a fast-growing community with 100k DAU and 250k registered users, of which 33% visit the service more than 5 days a week. Over 10k posts and 100k comments are shared within the community daily. Womanstalk – South Korea’s first and largest fashion-beauty video commerce platform Womanstalk is South Korea’s first and largest fashion-beauty video commerce platform with over 1.2m registered users and 210k+ products. It aims to enhance the mobile shopping experience by helping customers discover and share the latest products and trends via short videos. More than 100 video influencers, including celebrities, YouTubers, and its own influencers called “W-Crew”, share their thoughts through product reviews and expertise in fashion, food, and beauty. Cobak – South Korea’s #1 mobile community for cryptocurrency enthusiasts Cobak is South Korea’s #1 mobile cryptocurrency community. Each month, over 300k cryptocurrency enthusiasts, visit Cobak to discuss blockchain-related topics including the latest blockchain news, trends, and market prices. Cobak also provides a live quiz show as a unique marketing service for blockchain projects. Why Focus on Korea? TTC Protocol believes that the partnership with key Korean social platforms is a perfect real-life sandbox environment to test-launch its first local ecosystem for the following reasons: Quick Tech Adoption: More than half the population of Korea resides within a 100 km radius of Seoul, its capital, and the majority are highly educated (>~70% attended university). It is one of the most-wired countries in the world with some of the fastest Internet available. Korea has a unique setting where information and trends can spread more quickly than other parts of the world. Wide User Coverage: 7.5m users is a significant number by itself, yet what is more impressive is that there are only about 15m millennials (aged 14 to 36) in Korea. With these new partnerships, TTC Protocol will quickly penetrate a majority of the Korean millennial market, creating a powerful network effect. Digital Currency Friendly: Korea was one of the first countries to begin purchasing digital assets with fiat currency. In early 2000, a Korean citizen reportedly paid over 25k USD for a digital sword in a popular MMORPG. This trend continues today; one recent study claims that 40% of white-collar Korean workers own or have owned one or more cryptocurrencies. Brian Cheong, President, and Founder of TTC Protocol, said, “this dAPP partnership with four, number-one vertical social platforms in Korea is only the first step for the mass adoption of blockchain.” He added that “considering that top Ethereum dAPPs have around one-thousand daily active users, we are very excited to see millions of users being migrated onto blockchain; TTC Protocol will lead the mass user adoption movement.” TTC Protocol recently launched their “Merapi” Testnet which is currently undergoing penetration and security testing. In the following months, the four new dAPP partners will be integrated with the TTC SDK to simulate and test the TTC Reward Engine (TReE) before going live to the public in Q1 2019. TTC Protocol plans to expand its partnerships to other regions such as Indonesia, Thailand, and Vietnam.

CCN urges readers to conduct their own research with due diligence into the company, product or service mentioned in the press release. As the demand for digital and crypto-assets grows, the long-term success of trading platforms is dependent on several factors including architecture design, scalability, ease of use, security, and the handling of highly-volatile market conditions. BitMax.io (“BitMax”) is a new autonomous digital asset trading platform designed to be the global operator of crypto exchanges, providing cryptocurrency trading services to a broad clientele including institutions, professional traders, and private investors. BitMax.io prides themselves as having the lowest transaction fees in the industry at 0.04%. Founder George Cao graduated from both the University of Chicago and the University of Science and Technology of China. After receiving his Ph.D. in Computer Science, George worked at Wall Street Knight Capital and Barclays Capital specializing in quantitative trading and venture capital. Later, as CEO for the quantitative trading fund Delpha Capital Management, George successfully identified, invested, and incubated several blockchain projects in New York. BitMax.io has attracted the attention of many top crypto venture capital firms including FBG Capital, BitMain, Matrix Partners China, DHVC, GBIC, Perseverance Capital, and Palm Drive. They reportedly collected over 17,000 followers on their Telegram and WeChat social media channels within the first 10 days of operation. To better understand how and why BitMax.io has received so much attention, it is important to reiterate their unique position in the market. Leveraging their quant trading background and deep knowledge of the capital market, BitMax.io is building out their core institutional-grade trading platform and full exchange operations with an innovative approach to transaction-fee based “Trans-Fee Mining” model as part of overall liquidity strategy. The Trans-Fee Mining model works by reimbursing trading fees to traders in the form of the exchange’s own tokens. The more traders trade, the more tokens they receive, hence the term “mining”. The Trans-Fee Mining model is an effective incentive mechanism to drive volume to exchanges, pushing the exchange token’s value higher and converting users to traders. Additionally, BitMax.io’s transaction fees are the lowest in the industry at 0.04%. BitMax understands that while the Trans-Fee Mining approach will help drive short-term token performance and transaction volume, it cannot be solely relied upon to support a healthy token economy; risks must be mitigated to prevent a pump and dump of the exchange’s token. In response, BitMax has come up with a clever lock-up and recall mechanism to prevent their tokens from being undersold. These two key strategies help to mitigate risks and protect BitMax.io investors.\n",

In the 90’s when the internet was gradually gaining mass adoption, it was accompanied by mass education. The more information you have about something, the more inclined you are to use it. Blockchain enthusiasts tell anyone who cares to listen that the current development of this novel technology is parallel to the days of the internet. This is why it is termed the fourth revolution. A large chunk of adoption activities have been taking place in Western countries, only recently has the tide shifted to Africa. Before now, speculation over the volatile price of cryptocurrencies was the order of the day, with few if any, aware of the inherent potentials in blockchain, the underlying technology. For adoption to accelerate, education has to trump speculation. Moreover, before innovation of any magnitude can happen, there has to be some form of education. Speed, transparency, security, decentralization, ease of access, are just some of the features of blockchain that makes it suitable for addressing Africa’s myriad of economic and industrial development issues. Daily, indigenous blockchain startups are coming up with actual use cases that would help solve local problems. As part of the KuBitX ecosystem, blockchain can help Africa solve the problem of high transaction fees and speed of transaction when it comes to remittances. If blockchain is used to digitize the land registry, cases of land fraud would become extinct. Running financial activities of the economy on the blockchain can help check corruption in both the public and private sector, not to mention boosting of cross-border e-commerce through crypto payments. In this vein, there has been a surge in education focused events happening around the continent. At least weekly, one hears about a conference, seminar or workshop geared towards mass education of all things blockchain and crypto. Mass adoption through mass education is one of the foundational goals of KuBitX, a global exchange founded with the vision of helping Africa position herself for a financially secure future, using blockchain. To facilitate this, KuBitX has a system of Global Channel Ambassadors, charged with the duty of disseminating blockchain and crypto education to the grassroots. To that market woman, to that cobbler down the road, the unbanked, the underrepresented, the ones who are originally meant to be the beneficiaries of Satoshi’s vision. Other than intimating the masses with the near unlimited potentials of blockchain, KuBitX intends to intensify educational activities on training blockchain developers, and thus curb another century of brain drain. Demand for blockchain related skills worldwide surpasses available options. With properly structured education and mentorship programs in Africa, indigenously trained blockchain professionals could bridge this gap in the nearest future. On the regulation side, just Kenya and South Africa seem to have a definite framework in place. Most African countries are adopting a cautious approach by not outrightly banning cryptocurrencies or blockchain, but issuing warnings to businesses and individuals dealing with cryptocurrencies. Understandably, the negative reputation of cryptocurrency has spilled over into blockchain. This is where proper education is essential so that our regulatory authorities are better informed when taking their stance on blockchain and crypto. Some countries like Kenya and Mauritius are positively embracing the technology by setting up sandboxes and working committees or task force.\n",

      "The race to build the best public blockchain will be won by those that would scale in line with volume. On a Sunday, a blockchain project realistically did it, though for 24 hours.

As it found, the network faced no disruptions or delays as the test intensified. None of the transactions on its system – undertaken by users for DEX orders, transfers, token creation, etc. – experienced any slowdown, either. The Waves blockchain, according to data provided by PYWAVES, recorded a total of 108,741 transactions. Among them, 60,933 were Mass Transfers which, per Waves blog post, are specialized transactions that can hold 100 transfer at once. “A total of 6,141,108 transfers was processed by the network, with the blockchain supporting hundreds of transactions per second at peak times,” the post claimed.

But, it faced the same problem CryptoKitties – a decentralized application launched on Ethereum’s blockchain – slowed down transactions on the network. While Bitcoin has opted for third-party solutions like Lightning Network to handle the volume [temporarily], Ethereum is following a test-and-implement approach by taking in answers from its community developers. Waves, to achieve a similar goal, have implemented a tech called Waves NG that helps to scale the Waves Network by selecting miners in advance, thus minimizing latency and maximizing throughput. According to Waves’ CEO and co-founder Sasha Ivanov, the protocol’s deployment on their blockchain helped them process the record transactions. “Bitcoin processes just a few transactions per second,” he said. “Ethereum’s capacity is into double-digit tps, and a handful of other blockchains have improved on this incrementally in various ways. WAVES has implemented tech that enables a step-change in transaction volumes — not just in the lab, but in the real world, on MainNet, as these figures prove beyond doubt.” The Waves post noted that other blockchain projects had not exceeded more than 2 million transactions per day. However, a tweet from Ivanov admitted that EOS, a semi-decentralized blockchain project, had in fact executed 5 million transactions within a 24-hour period. EOS had 5.5 mil at most. — Sasha Ivanov (@sasha35625) October 23, 2018 A commentator also posted a chart from Blocktivity that suggested Waves was behind five blockchain projects concerning transaction volume.
