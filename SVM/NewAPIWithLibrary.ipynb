FILE PHOTO: A tray of bullion grade 2017 Sovereigns are seen at The Royal Mint, in Llantrisant, Wales, Britain, January 25, 2017. REUTERS/Rebecca Naden/File Photo By Peter Hobson LONDON (Reuters) - Britain’s Royal Mint has frozen plans to launch a digital gold token after a partnership with U.S. exchange group CME failed and the government vetoed a plan to have the tokens trade on a cryptocurrency exchange, three sources told Reuters. The demise of the potentially ground-breaking project, named Royal Mint Gold (RMG), highlights the wariness of governments to become involved in the largely unregulated world of cyptocurrencies, which exploded into the public eye last year with the stellar rise of bitcoin. As other mints and fintech startups race to set up similar products, it could squander the chances of Britain’s Mint leading the field to build gold into a multi-billion dollar digital asset class. It also reflects a cooling of enthusiasm toward digital assets at the CME, three sources said. The project would have been the first time a government of a developed economy had become directly involved with a crypto currency exchange, analysts and traders said. The 1,100-year old Mint announced its plan to issue tokens worth up to $1 billion on a blockchain-based trading platform run by CME in 2016, saying they would give investors an easy way to buy and trade physical gold held in its vaults. Royal Mint Gold was to launch in the autumn of 2017, but CME decided at the last minute to pull out, leaving the Mint without a trading venue, sources said. “CME’s management changed, and they walked away, didn’t want to get involved,” one of the sources said. When a blindsided Mint sought to save the project by partnering with a cryptocurrency exchange, Britain’s finance ministry in early 2018 refused to permit it, seeing the union as too big a gamble with the reputation of the government and the Mint, the sources added. The Mint is 100 percent owned by the government. Asked for comment, the Mint said its digital gold had been due to launch in spring this year. “Sadly, due to market conditions this did not prove possible at this time, but we will revisit this if and when market conditions are right,” it said. A Treasury spokesman referred Reuters’ questions to the Mint. CME said it was “continuing to assess client demand with our partner and have nothing new to report at this time.” Governments are wary of cryptocurrencies, and few international standards have emerged to tame extreme price volatility, regular thefts from exchanges and the risk that digital currencies could be used to launder money or finance terrorism. In Britain cryptocurrency exchanges remain unregulated. Its finance ministry, central bank and financial watchdog are looking at whether rules are needed for cryptocurrencies and the use of blockchain technology in finance. CHANGE IN STRATEGY Gold is seen as a natural fit with cryptocurrencies because both assets attract investors looking for alternatives to state-sponsored monetary systems which they distrust. The Mint’s plan was similar to a type of digital money known as stable coins that are pegged to major currencies or other assets to avoid the volatility suffered by bitcoin and others. The Mint had hoped to appeal to investors wanting digital assets but with the reassurance of a trusted issuer and to create a new revenue stream as use of mass circulation coins, its core business for more than a millennium, dwindles. Royal Mint Gold also fit into a push by CME to develop digital asset classes and blockchain technologies. CME launched bitcoin futures contracts last year, one of the first to do so, and has invested in digital technology startups through a ventures arm. But CME’s priorities shifted after CEO Phupinder Gill retired in late 2016 and Sandra Ro, CME’s head of digitization, left in July 2017, sources said. “There was a change in strategy,” said one source, adding that digitization was de-emphasized. Asked to comment, CME said: “It is not correct to say we have ‘de-emphasized’ digitization and remain committed to pursuing our digitization strategy.” After the government vetoed the plan to trade Royal Mint Gold on a crypto exchange, the Mint’s new chief executive Anne Jessop, appointed in February 2018, decided to shut the project down, the sources said. Around four staff in London were let go in March and a further 7-8 lost in Wales, where the Mint is also based, in May. The project is now frozen, the sources said. Meanwhile, others are launching rival products. Australia’s Perth Mint and the Royal Canadian Mint are involved with digital gold products that launched this year and trade using technology supplied by fintech startups. Both mints declined to say how much gold had been bought through these platforms. Gold-backed cryptocurrencies have also proliferated, though none has yet achieved the success of cryptos such as bitcoin, Etherium and Ripple, which have attracted hundreds of billions of dollars in investment.\n",

      "At Bloomberg Ideas, an event that features leading experts in various industries, George Mason University economics professor Tyler Cowen stated that if crypto remains illegal, adoption will be difficult to achieve. “If crypto stays illegal, it will be ghettoized, and that will make it harder for it to spread ultimately.” However, in major markets including the US, Japan, South Korea, Singapore, Switzerland, and the UK, the usage and trading of cryptocurrencies are legal, with sufficient regulatory frameworks in place to protect investors in the global digital asset exchange market. Already Regulated According to Cowen, regulation around cryptocurrencies as an emerging asset class has to be solidified further to attract more investors into the market and encourage merchants to adopt cryptocurrencies as an alternative payment method to fiat currencies. For years, economists have mischaracterized cryptocurrencies as criminal money, an unregulated asset class, and an inefficient payment system, as seen in the recent outburst of widely recognized economist Nouriel Roubini. The negative stance towards cryptocurrencies portrayed by the majority of leading economists has been expected by the cryptocurrency industry. As decentralized financial networks, consensus currencies challenge the fundamental belief of economists that fiat currencies serve as the base monetary system of the global economy. But, it is of utmost importance, at least for companies that provide services in the finance sector, to consider the possibility of digital assets potentially competing against fiat currencies in the long-term due the declining trust towards middlemen and financial institutions by millennials. As former Goldman sachs CEO and chairman Lloyd Blankfein emphasized, who previously stated that it is “arrogant” for economists and bankers to think crypto has no future, there exists a chance that cryptocurrencies could arise and evolve into a major asset class in the years to come. “If you go through that fiat currency where they say this is worth what it’s worth because I, the government, says it is, why couldn’t you have a consensus currency?” Hence, while the skepticism towards malpractices and poor protocols utilized by some cryptocurrencies in the global market is encouraged, intentionally mischaracterizing the asset class as an “illegal” payment method and currency is highly inappropriate and more importantly, inaccurate. The Japanese government has recently allowed 21 cryptocurrency exchanges to form a consortium and self-regulate the local digital asset exchange market, with a national licensing program in place to oversee businesses in the industry. The government of South Korea officially recognized the cryptocurrency market as a legitimate industry, acknowledging the blockchain as a core technology in the fourth industrial revolution. Gopax, a leading exchange in the local market, is financed and operated by Shinhan, the 2nd largest commercial bank in the nation. Crypto is Not Illegal Based on the regulatory frameworks established in major regions, it is evident that cryptocurrency remains legal as a payment method, a remittance system, and as a currency. Even China, which implemented a blanket ban on cryptocurrency trading in September 2017, has recently recognized Bitcoin as a property under local regulations, allowing individuals and businesses to hold and send or receive cryptocurrencies legally.\n",

      "According to Al Kelly, the CEO of Visa, the company could support crypto in the future if the global market moves in the direction of embracing consensus currencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. In the short to mid-term, Kelly told Jim Cramer, the host of Mad Money, that cryptocurrencies as an asset class is not a threat to reserve currencies that serve as the basis of Visa’s products. But, he stated that as the adoption of cryptocurrencies improve in the years to come, Visa will facilitate the demand for the asset class. “I think there has to be some market that it becomes somewhat like a fiat currency in order for us to be comfortable. If it goes in that direction, we will move in that direction. We want to be in the middle, Jim, of every payment flow in the world regardless of how it happens or what the currency is behind it. So if we have to go there, we will go there. But right now, it’s more of a commodity than a payment vehicle.” In the Middle Visa is the most influential credit card service company in the finance sector and is amongst the most profitable businesses in the market alongside Mastercard. In the long-term, Kelly emphasized that Visa will eventually serve as a middleman to attract crypto users to send and receive digital assets with Visa on its platforms, by providing fees to the company. However, by the time Visa would feel comfortable in integrating cryptocurrencies, which as the CEO described it as when the asset class is established utilized by the mainstream, cryptocurrencies would not require middlemen to process payments. With non-custodial wallets and open-source platforms, users of cryptocurrencies can efficiently and securely transfer digital assets without paying additional fees on top of the trasnaction fee provided to the miners of the ecosystem. Currently, due to the lack of merchant adoption, it is difficult for crypto users to compensate merchants to purchase simple products like coffee and food. A financial institution at the size of Visa could single-handedly increase the adoption of crypto amongst merchants in a large capacity. But, the intent of Visa to target the cryptocurrency sector is to provide middleman services several years from now when cryptocurrencies are already accepted by merchants and being utilized as an alternative currency to reserve currencies like the US dollar. Fidelity’s Big Bet The time to support and experiment with cryptocurrencies is now, when it is experiencing exponential growth and is still at an early phase. Years down the line, the cryptocurrency sector could heavily rely on decentralized systems and services, which even platforms within the market including Binance expect, as seen in the development of the Binance decentralized exchange. Already, Fidelity, Goldman Sachs, and Citigroup have started to serve investors in the cryptocurrency market by seeing sufficient demand for the new asset class, while Visa, Morgan Stanley, and several other financial institutions remain cautious in entering the cryptocurrency market.

      "CNBC’s Ryan NeuNer, who hosts CryptoTrader, has promised to release details on the anticipated Coinbase Initial Public Offering. CNBC Cryptotrader exposes details of the Coinbase IPO raise tomorrow on a Cryptotrader exclusive. pic.twitter.com/YG4UOP3ju8 — Ran NeuNer (@cryptomanran) October 25, 2018 CNBC previously reported that Coinbase was likely to take the “most obvious path” and become a public company. According to screencaps published along with the tweet, Coinbase has approximately 25 million users, around 600,000 of whom trade monthly. Coinbase earned almost half a billion dollars last year, 80% of which was from consumers. The firm’s recent announcement that it had been approved as an independent custodian in New York will likely only improve its revenues. The IPO prospects of Coinbase are interesting. It will be one of the first major stock symbols to be directly tied to the value and performance of crypto assets, in that the performance of the company very much relies on the health of the crypto economy. At the same time, it raises the question as to why investors wouldn’t simply invest in the currencies themselves as opposed to investing in one of a host of companies who facilitate acquisition, stewardship, and trading of such currencies. In recent months, crypto companies have floated the idea of pursuing initial public offerings, including Bitmain. The new reality offers Wall Street investors a chance to play in cryptocurrencies without actually getting their hands dirty in them. It also opens up new capital for the industry, which for years has been limited primarily to existing crypto holders in terms of pools of potential capital. Ironically, the chaos and corruption of the traditional stock market and banking industry played a major role in the development of Bitcoin. Satoshi’s first block famously included a headline from a recent newspaper of the time: Now a decade later, companies built on, born and bred of Bitcoin and other cryptos are, in some senses, returning to the fold, offering traditional stocks to traditional investors and financial outfits. We come full circle and the new reality perhaps provide a degree of uncertainty for those who thought they’d figured the market out already. Featured image from Shutterstock.\n",

      "Cryptocurrency exchange and brokerage giant Coinbase has provided a major stamp of approval to one of several recently launched USD-pegged cryptocurrency “stablecoins” seeking to supplant tether (USDT) as the leader in this burgeoning market niche. The San Francisco-based Coinbase on Tuesday announced that beginning today, customers can buy, sell, send, and receive USD Coin, the cryptocurrency initially launched by fellow cryptocurrency unicorn Circle. Coinbase customers throughout the world can send and receive the token, which is backed by physical dollars stored in company-controlled bank accounts, while U.S. customers — excluding those in New York — can buy and sell the token on Coinbase.com. USDC is not currently listed on Coinbase Pro — the firm’s order-book cryptocurrency exchange — though the company says it will be added to this platform “in the coming weeks.” Commenting on its decision to support the USDC stablecoin, Coinbase said that fiat-based blockchain currencies could contribute to the development of “a more open financial system” and could further the adoption of decentralized applications (dApps): “The advantage of a blockchain-based digital dollar like USDC is easier to program with, to send quickly, to use in dApps, and to store locally than traditional bank account-based dollars. That’s why we think of it as an important step towards a more open financial system.” Coinbase also noted that stablecoins like USDC are ideal for business purposes and e-commerce applications, as payments denominated in these tokens can be made at any time of day without the inherent risks of price volatility associated with using bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as working capital. At present, though, stablecoins are primarily used as a USD proxy in cryptocurrency trading. Collectively, fiat-pegged assets see more than $2 billion in daily trading volume, with the vast majority of those trades currently denominated in the controversial tether token. In adding support for USDC, Coinbase joins Circle as a founding member of the CENTRE Consortium, which governs the development of issuance of USD Coin and other stablecoins that the consortium may develop in the future. According to the announcement, Coinbase had already partnered with Circle to build the underlying technology behind USDC, which is structured as an ERC-20 token on the Ethereum network, though the full extent of Coinbase’s involvement had not previously been made public. In launching USDC through a partnership with Coinbase, Jeremy Allaire, co-founder and CEO of Circle, emphasized the importance of creating an asset that has no single owner or issuer. “Coinbase joining us to co-found CENTRE and launch USDC reinforces the value of a shared, standard, interoperable stablecoin. Like internet standards, USDC is now not owned by one single company, but distributed among network participants according to clear rules, regulations, and collectively-owned software,” he said. “When we began work on CENTRE and USDC last year, we envisioned collaborating with a consortium of industry leaders to set new standards for global value exchange and financial contracts. We’ve been thrilled to collaborate with Coinbase on CENTRE, and we look forward to welcoming more partners who share this vision.” Featured Image from Shutterstock\n",

      "While much of the world grapples with the development of crypto-related policy, Ukraine has become a first mover. The eastern European country has unveiled a path for the adoption of cryptocurrencies, with Ukraine’s Ministry of Economic Development and Trade beginning the process for the legalization of virtual assets, an endeavor that is projected to take three years. According to the announcement: “The Economic Development Ministry initiates the adoption of the concept of state policy in the field of virtual assets, the purpose of which is to create understandable conditions for conducting activities in the field of virtual assets and virtual currencies.” The government organization will set out to define key terms in the crypto space, including “virtual currency/cryptocurrency, virtual assets, ICO/ITO, mining, smart contracts and token,” according to local Ukrainian publication Ukrinform. In doing so, they will be giving developers and blockchain founders parameters for operating in the space, including the tens of thousands of crypto engineers that are engaged by Silicon Valley startups. It could also bolster the amount of international investment that is directed into Ukrainian blockchain startups. Crypto policy will be crafted over two stages that will unfold between now and 2021. Fits and Starts There have been greens shoots of crypto regulation in Ukraine for months, with one member of Parliament, Alexei Mushak, revealing in the spring that the path to the legalization of cryptocurrencies was in the works and at that time urging feedback from market participants. Mushak, who made the announcement on Facebook, held BTC as of 2016, according to public forums. Ukraine Drafts Law to Legalize Cryptocurrencies, Fuels Debate In Crypto Community https://t.co/Sg7tUis7vj — CCN (@CryptoCoinsNews) May 17, 2018 Mushak said at the time that the country was looking to establish transparency in the market, one in which blockchain development would be nurtured across sectors of the economy while holders of crypto would be protected from “unsubstantiated criminal prosecutions.” Meanwhile, the law will also be designed to fight fraud such as “money laundering and terrorism financing” that tends to be associated with an “underground” crypto market that was common in Ukraine under a different administration. Regulatory clarity remains elusive in the blockchain space, and Ukraine is ahead of many jurisdictions in its efforts. Separately, there are a couple of crypto-friendly bills being considered, one of which would lift taxes on crypto-related business for at least a decade, incentivizing both businesses and individuals to transact in cryptocurrencies. Ukrainians trade nearly $2 million in cryptocurrencies daily across approximately two-dozen coins, and hundreds of local merchants already accept altcoins as a payment method.

      "The Spanish Ministry of Finance has closed a legal loophole allowing holders of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to skirt asset declaration laws. Announcing a draft anti-fraud law approved by the Council of Ministers earlier today, Finance Minister María Jesús Montero explained that the new law will mandate “the identification of the holders and the balances contributed by these virtual currencies,” obligating crypto asset holders to declare all cryptocurrency asset holdings. Spanish daily newspaper ABC.es reports that Montero further stated that all Spaniards with offshore currency holdings in fiat or crypto must declare these holdings in an annual declaration to Spain’s Agencia Tributaria. New Spanish Taxation Measures Affecting Crypto Holders The draft law is intended to raise a further 850 million euros in tax revenue at a time when Spain is in desperate need of extra government revenue to fund investment and welfare spending in a country with 33.8 percent youth unemployment. To assist revenue generation efforts, the Spanish government has introduced a draft bill to impose a 0.2 percent tax on purchases of listed shares valued at more than a billion euros. Whether this will have any impact on cryptocurrency investment remains unclear at the moment as no further information was forthcoming at press time. In what may possibly be significant news for crypto traders depending on the Spanish government’s interpretation of crypto trading as a commercial activity, the so-called “Tobin tax” provision in the draft bill states that intraday net transactions will be taxed, which means that users buying and selling several assets in the same session will only be taxed based on their position at the start of trading and at close, regardless of the number of trades that took place during the period in question. ABC.es also reports that a taskforce made up of 200 officials will be mobilized to monitor tax evasion and tax defaulters who owe the Spanish Treasury 600,000 euros or more, which is significantly down from the previous threshold of 1 million euros. This effort will be assisted with the creation of a framework for supplying VAT information immediately. The list of countries designated as tax havens will also be expanded as the Spanish government looks to block all available loopholes for tax avoidance. In July, CCN reported that five countries namely, the UK, US, Australia, Canada and the Netherlands created the Joint Chiefs of Global Tax Enforcement (J5) partnership aimed at combating transnational tax evasion and money laundering.\n",

      "Cryptocurrency mining firm Bitfury is considering an initial public offering in Amsterdam or London as early as 2019. The move would make Bitfury the first major crypto IPO listed in Europe. The Amsterdam-based blockchain startup could seek a valuation of $3 billion to $5 billion, sources told Bloomberg. The company is speaking with several investment banks to explore its options, including debuting on a Hong Kong exchange. No final decisions have been made. Bitfury has been making key moves to expand its business, even as the cryptocurrency market remains sluggish. Bitfury Rival Recently Launched IPO Bitfury, which launched in 2011 as a bitcoin mining company and maker of crypto-mining gear, has since expanded into blockchain research. It expects to report revenue of $450 million for the last fiscal year. Last month, Bitfury rolled out a new SHA256 application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) chip that can achieve a hashrate of 120GH/s with a power efficiency of 55mW/GH. Two days later, Bitfury’s much-larger rival — Bitmain Technologies — unveiled a new 7nm ASIC mining chip for the SHA256 algorithm used by bitcoin, bitcoin cash, and other virtual currencies, as CCN has reported. With its proposed IPO, Bitfury is following in the footsteps of Bitmain — the world’s most valuable cryptocurrency company. In September 2018, Bitmain filed for an initial public offering in Hong Kong with a potential valuation of up to $3 billion. CNBC Analyst: Coinbase Mulls IPO Meanwhile, Coinbase, the largest U.S. cryptocurrency exchange, may be preparing to go public, as CCN has reported. Crypto analyst Ryan NeuNer, who hosts the show “CryptoTrader” on CNBC South Africa, promised to reveal details of Coinbase’s purported IPO soon. CNBC Cryptotrader exposes details of the Coinbase IPO raise tomorrow on a Cryptotrader exclusive. pic.twitter.com/YG4UOP3ju8 — Ran NeuNer (@cryptomanran) October 25, 2018 “I guess it’s big news!” NeuNer boasted on Twitter. I guess it’s big news! pic.twitter.com/3RqYxkvGXf — Ran NeuNer (@cryptomanran) October 26, 2018 As CCN has reported, NeuNer recently predicted that bitcoin prices were “about to explode,” citing bullish market buzz about the near-term possibility of an SEC-approved bitcoin ETF. Since then, BTC prices have remained generally flat. In February 2018, Ran Neuner predicted that bitcoin prices would top $50,000 by the end of 2018. So far, that forecast appears unrealistic given current market conditions. For the record, I am pinning this tweet. Bitcoin will finish 2018 at $50 000. — Ran NeuNer (@cryptomanran) February 2, 2018 The traditional financial industry has slowly but gradually started recognizing cryptocurrencies as a viable asset class as its mainstream popularity continues to escalate. The lack of an established regulatory framework has been cited as a key reason for Wall Street’s hesitation in throwing its full support behind the burgeoning market. That said, there are signs that a sea change afoot. Fidelity Investments, whose assets under management tops $2 trillion, plans to launch a separate company to provide cryptocurrency custody and institutional trade-execution services. “Our goal is to make digitally-native assets, such as bitcoin, more accessible to investors,” Fidelity CEO Abigail Johnson said. “We expect to continue investing and experimenting, over the long-term, with ways to make this emerging asset class easier for our clients to understand and use.” Featured image from Shutterstock.\n",

      "Indian cryptocurrency trading platform Unocoin has found itself amidst heated controversy over the launch of its first cryptocurrency kiosk in Bengaluru. While the existence of the machine had already been leaked prior, the company officially unveiled it roughly ten days ago, on October 14. This is the first time that a physical machine has aided the purchase and sale of cryptocurrency in India. Unlike other Bitcoin ATMs installed around the world, the kiosk is only accessible by users that have previously registered with Unocoin’s trading platform. As long as that requirement is satisfied, users can use the machine to deposit or withdraw a minimum of 1,000 Indian Rupees (INR) per transaction. In the case of cash deposits, these funds can be used to trade or purchase digital currencies on Unocoin or the company’s crypto to crypto trading platform, Unodax. Crypto Kiosk or Bitcoin ATM Shortly after the kiosk went live, however, questions regarding the machine’s legality began pouring in from local publications and social media. Most of the concerns had some merit, given the Indian financial regulator’s strict stance on cash handling, ATM establishment and cryptocurrency trading. However, other rumors were vaguer and alleged that the machine was being investigated by the Indian cyber cell division. The sudden influx of criticism naturally did not go unnoticed by the company. A Twitter statement published October 21 read: “Our Machine didn’t go well with few mainstream media reports who projected it under a negative light. The machine is still under final testing mode and it will be up and running in the upcoming week.” Following this, the company proceeded to move the machine to an undisclosed location, presumably to avoid further backlash in the interim. We reached out to Unocoin CEO Mr. Sathvik Vishwanath to understand the company’s position on the matter and how it has managed to stay within the confines of the law. He responded that the machine has been intentionally designed to not function as a typical automated teller machine (ATM). He instead believes that the term ‘kiosk’ would be better suited for Unocoin’s installation. According to Vishwanath, the distinction allows the machine to fall outside the scope of the banking network and by extension, the regulation on ATMs. Vishwanath chose to not comment on the rumors, asserting that they were unsubstantiated and were not grounded in reality. When asked about plans for expansion in other parts of the country, he said that Unocoin will look into adding more kiosks in Mumbai and Delhi in due time. The Revival of Crypto Trading in India Digital currency trading was effectively dealt a huge blow earlier this year by the Indian central bank, Reserve Bank of India (RBI). After issuing several cautionary circulars between 2013 and 2017, the regulator directed all financial institutions operating in the country to cease relationships with cryptocurrency companies within a three month time frame. Since the ban came into effect on July 6, Indian cryptocurrency exchanges have not had access to banking services or a way to process crypto-fiat transactions. Unocoin was one of the several cryptocurrency exchanges affected by the ban. Shortly before the regulation was fully imposed, however, it announced the launch of Unodax, a crypto-crypto trading platform that eliminates the need for fiat currency. However, other exchanges decided to introduce peer to peer trading to continue providing fiat liquidity. Structured similarly to LocalBitcoins, both WazirX and Koinex Loop offer users the ability to buy and sell cryptocurrency directly from each other. Notably, both platforms require their respective users to complete KYC verification. Featured image from Unocoin.\n",

      "Crypto loans provider Nexo has announced that XRP is now accepted as a collateral option for users to access instant loans. Announcing the move on its official blog last week, Nexo revealed that the decision was taken following the outcome of a community poll which indicated that users wanted XRP added as an option. The move potentially adds another significant use case to XRP, which is already the third most capitalised cryptocurrency, just behind ether. XRP Continues Upward Trajectory The news comes at a time when XRP is increasingly asserting its importance in the crypto space, having recently risen to become the third largest cryptocurrency, recently even getting into second place ahead of ether, albeit briefly. Earlier today, CCN also reported that XRP gained a further 3 percent as its market valuation hit $18 billion. Driven largely by its use case as a disruptor of global cross-border payments system and with a reputation as one of the fastest and most scalable blockchain asset solutions, XRP is gaining popularity with investors who see long-term growth potential. With the new Nexo policy, XRP holders in need of quick cash can simply borrow against it instead of selling, which makes it easier to hold XRP for investment purposes, and eases selling pressure against the cryptocurrency. Nexo on its part now becomes the first ever lender to accept XRP as collateral for crypto loans, a move which the announcement describes as “an incredibly powerful utility feature” for XRP. Nexo’s LTV Gamble Speaking exclusively to CCN, Nexo loans Managing Partner Antoni Trenchev revealed that the company is raising the loan-to-value (LTV) ratio for XRP from 30 percent to 40 percent. This means that if a user deposits $10,000 worth of XRP, they get an instant credit line of $4,000. Currently, only Bitcoin and Ether have a higher LTV ratio of 50 percent. Speaking about the general growth of Nexo loans, Trenchev said: “The reception for Nexo’s crypto loans has been phenomenal. In under six months we have 120,000 people on the platform, and have already serviced tens of millions of dollars in 40+ currencies in the 200+ jurisdictions we are currently operating in.” In the announcement, it was also mentioned that the company plans to include Litecoin and Bitcoin Cash as collateral options in line with the results of another community poll. Giving a projected timeline for this to CCN, Trenchev said: “BCH and Litecoin are scheduled for this November and we are on track. On top of that we are looking to add another 6-7 collateral options in 2018. Being able to borrow against their coin is a great additional utility feature and is hugely appreciated by the respective communities.” Featured image from Shutterstock.\n",

      "Mastercard has gone all the way through the stages of the resistance proverb — “first they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win.” Cryptocurrencies & Mastercard: A Turbulent History Like most financial companies, Mastercard never expected the blockchain, and by the time they took note of it, they were unprepared for the changes it could and will bring. So their earliest reactions were, to say the least, not positive. A massive firm, however, they were at the same time studying the technology and looking for ways to utilize it, as well as looking for ways to legally make use of cryptocurrencies. The company has been all over the place on the issue, eventually admitting that it could be “good.” The Ultimate Irony: Fractional Reserve Blockchain Now, some years after initially associating cryptocurrencies with crime, Mastercard is seeking a patent for fractional reserve management of blockchain assets. You read that right, and there are likely a number of cryptonaughts laughing their heads off as they digest this. Fractional reserve banking is one of the problems Bitcoin was designed to solve. It is a practice which most who gravitate toward cryptocurrencies would prefer to see eradicated. In general, Bitcoiners are not fans of debt-based currency. Bitcoin and most other cryptocurrencies are therefore regarded as sound money. A Step Beyond Not Owning Your Keys: Not Even Being Sure the Institution Has Your Funds The patent Mastercard is seeking — application 20180308092 — describes a system which will simultaneously track crypto assets and fiat assets. Essentially, it’s a web wallet with a combination of cryptocurrency and fiat accounts. Bitcoin banking institutions like Coinbase have had trouble gaining traction with cryptocurrency natives over the years for the simple reason that the user/owner of the funds does not then hold the keys. In the cryptonaught’s eyes, not holding the keys to your coin is the same as not holding your coin at all. It can disappear, and there is nothing you can do about it. Thus, the largest component of Coinbase’s customers has been newcomers looking for convenient ways to acquire Bitcoin. The patent essentially describes a cryptocurrency credit card network. “Thus, there is a need to improve on the storage and processing of transactions that utilize blockchain currencies. Existing payment networks and payment processing systems that utilize fiat currency are specially designed and configured to safely store and protect consumer and merchant information and credentials and to transmit sensitive data between computing systems. In addition, existing payment systems are often configured to perform complex calculations, risk assessments, and fraud algorithm applications extremely fast, as to ensure quick processing of fiat currency transactions. Accordingly, the use of traditional payment networks and payment systems technologies in combination with blockchain currencies may provide consumers and merchants the benefits of the decentralized blockchain while still maintaining security of account information and provide a strong defense against fraud and theft.” They see a benefit to mixing traditional and cryptocurrency technologies, and the system described would likely include their existing products and payment networks. “Transactions that may be performed via a payment network may include product or service purchases, credit purchases, debit transactions, fund transfers, account withdrawals, etc. Payment networks may be configured to perform transactions via cash-substitutes, which may include payment cards, letters of credit, checks, transaction accounts, etc.” Mastercard seeks to do what it does best: process transactions. In the same way, funds can be moved around an exchange or a gambling site instantaneously once their deposits are cleared, Mastercard would like to make this possible for merchants. In this respect, despite the problems associated with fractional reserve anything, Mastercard could potentially make a massive contribution to the Bitcoin economy by enabling millions of existing clients to accept cryptocurrency payments. Patents take time to process, so we will see how this develops. Images from Shutterstock\n",

      "HTC launched a new blockchain-powered smartphone, “EXODUS 1,” Tuesday morning. The phone is the first of its kind—but don’t expect to see it on shelves alongside other mobile devices. The EXODUS 1 is wholly dedicated to blockchain encryption—all the way to how consumers initially order the device: The smartphone can only be purchased using Bitcoin or Ethereum. It will cost 0.15 Bitcoin or 4.78 Ethereum. “It’s been both 10 years since the launch of the first Android phone by HTC and nearly 10 years since the launch of Bitcoin and the Genesis Block. EXODUS 1 is a foundational element of the crypto internet,” Phil Chen, Decentralized Chief Officer at HTC, said in a statement. “For digital assets and decentralized apps to reach their potential, we believe mobile will need to be the main point of distribution.” In a bid for elevated smartphone security amid recent security breaches, Chen wants consumers to feel as if they truly own their data—browsing history, identity, assets, wallets, emails, and all—without the need for central authorities. HTC Chen’s brainchild, the EXODUS 1 is basically a digital vault and handheld hardware wallet disguised as any other shiny smartphone. The HTC EXODUS 1 features a secure enclave, a locked area of the device completely protected from the Android OS. The secure enclave will hold crypto keys, whether that is currencies or non-fungible tokens. The device will also offer an easy and secure way to recover keys lost in the hardware should you lose your phone or forget your key, ensuring each user maintains full custody at all times with no HTC interference. As this is the early access version of the device, HTC hopes cryptographers and developers from all over the world will join in on the discussion to help improve the strength of the secure enclave. To further develop and strengthen the technology, HTC will soon release APIs to allow third-party developers to use the EXODUS 1 specific hardware to protect keys and sign transactions. EXODUS 1 can be purchased through the early access program website and will be available in 34 countries including the US, Taiwan, HK, Singapore, New Zealand, UK, Austria, Norway, and other European countries.\n",

      "Privacy-focused Zcash, currently worth just over $110 per coin, has completed a network upgrade dubbed “Sapling” that it says will vastly improve transaction speed as well as reduce the actual size of transactions themselves. Zcash hopes that this will make mobile and other types of transactions more common and feasible on the network, saying it “introduces significant efficiency improvements for shielded transactions that will pave the way for broad mobile, exchange and vendor adoption of Zcash shielded addresses.” Zcash has two types of addresses. A standard “t”-type (transparent) address works in the same way as most cryptocurrencies: sender and receiver information are publicly available on the network at time of transaction. Shielded addresses work much more like Monero and other privacy-centric currencies in that it is almost impossible to be privy to transaction information aside from sums transacted without the sender or receiver revealing such information. The Sapling upgrade primarily improves the efficiency of private transactions. Shielded Transactions Now Up to 100 Times Lighter, 6 Times Faster The memory requirement for z-type transactions under the Sapling upgrade has been reduced to 40 megabytes and the hardware being used to authorize/create a transaction does not have to be the hardware that creates the “proof.” Both of these updates are important in the implementation of a mobile payment network built on Zcash. An added bonus of the upgrade is that transaction information can be accessed without exposing a private key – again, important for mobile transactions in that many users might not want to carry such important information on them at all times. The upgrade is mostly important to developers of mobile applications and exchange software who will see it as a way to offer Zcash products in a much more efficient manner. Sapling has been anticipated for months, as noted in our report on the previous Overwinter upgrade, but in an immediate sense it does not seem to have led to increased demand for ZEC. While volume is high, the price appears to be struggling – which should not be a surprise to anyone monitoring cryptocurrencies in 2018, as most of them seem to be having similar problems. All Major Exchanges Supporting Upgrade Essentially every exchange listing ZEC has supported the upgrade, meaning that private withdrawals will become much more feasible. While the technology behind Zcash still has some distance to go in order to successfully transact privately with the same efficiency as public blockchain tokens, the upgrade is a major step in that direction, and the reduced resource requirements will likely lead to increased adoption of the crypto. Spokesmen and developers of Zcash still maintain that continued upgrades of its protocol will eventually lead to “privacy-by-default” in cryptocurrency transactions, major platforms like Bitcoin have yet to make any notable moves in the same direction. Thus while the efforts of Zcash can be lauded and the existence of privacy-centric options is especially important in regions where there are dangers associated with monetary transactions, the dream of “privacy-by-default” has yet to be fully realized.

      "(This October 25 story corrects paragraph 23 to say staff were let go, not fired.) FILE PHOTO: A tray of bullion grade 2017 Sovereigns are seen at The Royal Mint, in Llantrisant, Wales, Britain, January 25, 2017. REUTERS/Rebecca Naden/File Photo By Peter Hobson LONDON (Reuters) - Britain’s Royal Mint has frozen plans to launch a digital gold token after a partnership with U.S. exchange group CME failed and the government vetoed a plan to have the tokens trade on a cryptocurrency exchange, three sources told Reuters. The demise of the potentially ground-breaking project, named Royal Mint Gold (RMG), highlights the wariness of governments to become involved in the largely unregulated world of cyptocurrencies, which exploded into the public eye last year with the stellar rise of bitcoin. As other mints and fintech startups race to set up similar products, it could squander the chances of Britain’s Mint leading the field to build gold into a multi-billion dollar digital asset class. It also reflects a cooling of enthusiasm toward digital assets at the CME, three sources said. The project would have been the first time a government of a developed economy had become directly involved with a crypto currency exchange, analysts and traders said. The 1,100-year old Mint announced its plan to issue tokens worth up to $1 billion on a blockchain-based trading platform run by CME in 2016, saying they would give investors an easy way to buy and trade physical gold held in its vaults. Royal Mint Gold was to launch in the autumn of 2017, but CME decided at the last minute to pull out, leaving the Mint without a trading venue, sources said. “CME’s management changed, and they walked away, didn’t want to get involved,” one of the sources said. When a blindsided Mint sought to save the project by partnering with a cryptocurrency exchange, Britain’s finance ministry in early 2018 refused to permit it, seeing the union as too big a gamble with the reputation of the government and the Mint, the sources added. The Mint is 100 percent owned by the government. Asked for comment, the Mint said its digital gold had been due to launch in spring this year. “Sadly, due to market conditions this did not prove possible at this time, but we will revisit this if and when market conditions are right,” it said. A Treasury spokesman referred Reuters’ questions to the Mint. CME said it was “continuing to assess client demand with our partner and have nothing new to report at this time.” Governments are wary of cryptocurrencies, and few international standards have emerged to tame extreme price volatility, regular thefts from exchanges and the risk that digital currencies could be used to launder money or finance terrorism. In Britain cryptocurrency exchanges remain unregulated. Its finance ministry, central bank and financial watchdog are looking at whether rules are needed for cryptocurrencies and the use of blockchain technology in finance. CHANGE IN STRATEGY Gold is seen as a natural fit with cryptocurrencies because both assets attract investors looking for alternatives to state-sponsored monetary systems which they distrust. The Mint’s plan was similar to a type of digital money known as stable coins that are pegged to major currencies or other assets to avoid the volatility suffered by bitcoin and others. The Mint had hoped to appeal to investors wanting digital assets but with the reassurance of a trusted issuer and to create a new revenue stream as use of mass circulation coins, its core business for more than a millennium, dwindles. Royal Mint Gold also fit into a push by CME to develop digital asset classes and blockchain technologies. CME launched bitcoin futures contracts last year, one of the first to do so, and has invested in digital technology startups through a ventures arm. But CME’s priorities shifted after CEO Phupinder Gill retired in late 2016 and Sandra Ro, CME’s head of digitization, left in July 2017, sources said. “There was a change in strategy,” said one source, adding that digitization was de-emphasized. Asked to comment, CME said: “It is not correct to say we have ‘de-emphasized’ digitization and remain committed to pursuing our digitization strategy.” After the government vetoed the plan to trade Royal Mint Gold on a crypto exchange, the Mint’s new chief executive Anne Jessop, appointed in February 2018, decided to shut the project down, the sources said. Around four staff in London were let go in March and a further 7-8 lost in Wales, where the Mint is also based, in May. The project is now frozen, the sources said. Meanwhile, others are launching rival products. Australia’s Perth Mint and the Royal Canadian Mint are involved with digital gold products that launched this year and trade using technology supplied by fintech startups. Both mints declined to say how much gold had been bought through these platforms. Gold-backed cryptocurrencies have also proliferated, though none has yet achieved the success of cryptos such as bitcoin, Etherium and Ripple, which have attracted hundreds of billions of dollars in investment.\n",

      "Jakarta, Indonesia, Oct. 23, 2018: Noorcoin launched its application demo for 57 Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) member countries in the annual session of the Islamic Chamber of Commerce, Industry & Agriculture (ICCIA) of the OIC on October 22-23 2018 in Jakarta. OIC is the second largest inter-governmental organization after the United Nations. The meeting is attended by the delegation from 57 OIC member countries. Noorcoin Founder and CEO, Sofia Koswara said, “OIC member countries, such as Brunei and Kingdom of Saudi Arabia as the guardian of two most holy cities with pilgrims from all over the world, was very serious about using Noorcoin. Banks in Saudi Arabia to the Zakat Council in the country began to think about the use of digital money as an alternative to long-term financial transactions. We believe once the application demo is completed, Noorcoin will reach acceleration in a few months.” Noorcoin COO, Thomas Yudhistira said, “The purpose of the application demo is not only to test the technological issue, but also the cultural and legal environment in each 57 OIC member countries. For example, there is a widespread misconception towards cryptocurrency in the Middle East due to the notion that it is against Sharia law. Muhammad Abu Bakar (certified Muslim legal expert) in a report says that cryptocurrencies are permissible under Sharia law. Noorcoin is developed with sharia compliance in mind so we are positive that we would be compliant to national sharia regulations, which to be proven with this testnet.” Noorcoin CBDO, Iskandar Purnomohadi said, “The application demo was run using Ethereum Virtual Server and Ethereum Ropsten Testnet before full implementation and transition on Zilliqa blockchain platform around Q1 2019. This is to show Noorcoin’s mobile application demo’s potential and usability for the Muslim community. Also in a later stage after ICO, Noorcoin also plans to back its cryptocurrency with gold, to increase stability and security for its holders.” As part of the launching, Noorcoin was awarded by World Achievement Institute (LEPRID) as the First Shariah Token in the World with its Advanced Technology. World Achievement Institute’s Director and Founder, Paulus Pangka said, “Technology innovation which has a mass positive impact to billion population need to be recognized and supported. Noorcoin shariah token is really the trailblazer, eligible for a world record” Ambassador of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to Indonesia HE Osamh Mohammed Abdullah Shuibi who attend the launch to represent the country to accept Noorcoin D-app demo testnet said, “The use of digital money in Islamic countries is very important. In addition to facilitating transactions, the main objective is to reduce the dominance of the US dollar. Noorcoin, the first digital Islamic money, can be used for Umrah and Hajj services, as well as inter-state transactions. There are three advantages that Noorcoin has, namely transparent, safe and low cost. At present some countries are experiencing a weakening of the currency against the US dollar. We must have an alternative.” Previously, Indonesia Presidential Chief of Staff, General (Retd.) Moeldoko, as reported in the media, saw positively on the Noorcoin proposal. According to him, the unity of Islamic countries joined in the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) in the field of economics and trade must continue to be improved. Therefore, the momentum of ICCIA OIC can be a unifying force. ABOUT NOORCOIN: Noorcoin is the First Sharia Token in the world, building award winning sharia-compliant crypto-token and platform, decentralized trust and reputation system working flawlessly together through a blockchain based on-chain real-time payment gateway. We are creating a shariah-compliant, decentralized payment and trust solution on the Zilliqa blockchain leveraging smart contract technology.

      "Cryptocurrencies do not pose a threat to Visa in the near term, but the credit card giant is prepared to implement crypto-friendly systems if the digital currencies become more established, Visa CEO Al Kelly told CNBC on Thursday. \"I think there has to be some market that it becomes somewhat like a fiat currency in order for us to be comfortable,\" Kelly said in an exclusive interview with \"Mad Money\" host Jim Cramer, adding that crypto was \"certainly\" not a threat in the short to medium term \"in any way.\" Fiat currencies are issued and backed by governments, like the U.S. dollar and the euro, as opposed to currencies that are backed by physical commodities like gold or silver. Some cryptocurrencies are backed by precious metals; others are seen as having inherent value. Kelly said Visa would consider entering the business of cryptocurrencies \"if we actually think that crypto starts moving from being more of a commodity to actually really being a payment instrument.\" \"If it goes in that direction, we will move in that direction,\" the CEO said. \"We want to be in the middle, Jim, of every payment flow in the world regardless of how it happens or what the currency is behind it. So if we have to go there, we will go there. But right now, its more of a commodity than a payment vehicle.\" Coinbase and Circle, two stalwarts of the crypto space, recently announced a joint venture to promote U.S.-dollar-backed digital coins known as \"stablecoins\" in an effort to offer viable payment alternatives to wild traders like bitcoin. The rise of cryptocurrencies has been fragmented and volatile, even as the digital currency market managed to withstand the stock markets most recent sell-off. In mid-October, however, digital currencies lost some $18 billion in market value. Shares of Visa climbed nearly 5 percent in Thursday trading as stocks mounted a recovery from Wednesdays brutal sell-off. Visas most recent earnings report, issued Wednesday, topped Wall Street estimates and painted a picture of global consumer confidence.\n",

      "Throughout the past 24 hours, Bitcoin price seemed to be demonstrating momentum above the $6,400 mark, showing signs of a potential breakout. However, an abrupt fall from $6,430 to $6,370 put an end to the breakout, as BTC failed to breach a minor resistance level. With the volume of BTC at around $3.4 billion on CoinMarketCap, the chance of a major breakout in the next 24 to 48 hours remains relatively low. Stability of Bitcoin: Same Range Over and Over Again On October 15, heavily affected by speculation around Tether (USDT) triggered by the issues between Tether LLC and its US dollar bank, the price of the BTC-to-USDT pair rose to around $7,700 on Bitfinex. As a consequence, the Bitcoin price on fiat-to-cryptocurrency exchanges such as Coinbase, Bitstamp, and Kraken also surged substantially to around $6,800. Since then, the price of BTC has fallen to the range of $6,350 to $6,450, stuck in the same range for more than 10 days since October 16. The sudden increase in the price of BTC on October 15 from $6,120 to $6,800 served as an important short-term catalyst to drive the recovery of Bitcoin. Influenced by the price movement of BTC in mid-October, throughout the past week, BTC has been able to defend the $6,300 support level well despite its insufficient volume and low trading activity in the cryptocurrency exchange market. Cryptocurrency trader and technical analyst Hsaka emphasized that in a period like this, taking leveraged trades and high-risk options is of extreme risk and presents relatively low returns. “Still range-bound. Not taking any leveraged positions here. Weekly open (white) is acting as support now. Both sides of the range have been tapped often enough now to serve as good levels playable on a break and retest.” The stability in the price of Bitcoin and the sideways market of crypto have negative affected the short-term price trend of small market cap tokens, which usually benefit from the stability of the dominant cryptocurrency. Decred, Power Ledger, Loom, Qtum, and Aeternity recorded losses in the range of 5 to 10 percent as the worst performing cryptocurrencies in the global market on October 25. The volume of Bitcoin is low but the daily trading volume of tokens and small market cap cryptocurrencies are continuing to record yearly lows. Tokens could initiate a strong recovery as they have done throughout 2018 if BTC recovers with solid volume. In the weeks to come, analysts do not expect investors to engage in high-risk trades. Ripple and Bitcoin Cash Struggling In recent months, Ripple (XRP), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), EOS, and Stellar (XLM) have demonstrated a price trend which reflects that of tokens and small market cryptocurrencies. The four major cryptotucrrencies recorded losses in the range of 1 to 3 percent against the US dollar. In the upcoming days, it is likely for the crypto market to see stability in the price of BTC and a gradual increase in its volume until BTC tests a major resistance level in the higher region of $6,000.

      "Over the past 24 hours, the cryptocurrency market has demonstrated the same trend it has shown throughout the past 12 days, with Bitcoin at $6,400. The volume of Bitcoin has increased by nearly 20 percent from $3.1 billion to $3.5 billion, hinting a rise in trading activity in the cryptocurrency exchange market across major digital asset trading platforms. The sudden rise in the volume of Bitcoin, which has been stagnant since mid-October, could lead to a potential short-term positive movement on the upside in the days to come. Is Bitcoin Ready to Climb? Various technical indicators of BTC suggest that the dominant cryptocurrency is building momentum to breakout of several minor resistance levels in the high $6,000 region. Cryptocurrency trader and technical analyst Uzi stated that if BTC can surpass the $6,400 mark with ease, then it is possible for the asset to eye a breakout above the $6,500 mark. “BTC looks ready to break out of the bull pennant on the 4H, price closed above the 50 & 20 day EMA today and MACD is bullish now, resistance is looking like 6417-6420 here, lets see if we can break it soon.” The volume of BTC increased subsequent to the closure of a daily candle with lowest recorded volume in the past 10 months. During the weekend, the volume of the cryptocurrency exchange market tends to dip, alongside over-the-counter (OTC) markets that are said to process three times the daily trading volume of major cryptocurrency exchanges. Hence, the rise in the volume of BTC on a Saturday is a positive indicator for the short-term trend of the asset. If the momentum of BTC above the $6,400 can be sustained throughout Sunday and continues on next week, the positive sentiment around the market will likely allow large market cap cryptocurrencies to rise in value. Throughout the past week, in a sideways market, small tokens recorded decent gains against Bitcoin in the range of 5 to 10 percent. However, major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, and Bitcoin Cash have not been able to demonstrate signs of recovery. Von, another recognized crypto analyst, said that BTC is expected to hold $6,400 comfortably in the next 12 to 24 hours. “BTC having a calm Sunday while kindly closing that Tether premium for us, currently $80 USD price very stable and Tether prices look likely to meet imminently I would expect $6,400 to hold and provide good territory for bounce, breaking that trés bearish.” Still Conditional While the trading activity in the cryptocurrency exchange market increased over the past two days, the majority of traders are still waiting out for the market to demonstrate a major movement. A potential increase in the price of Bitcoin to the $6,500 to $6,600 range is dependent on the ability of the market to sustain decent volume and momentum in the upcoming days.\n",

      "Over the last 24 hours, the volume of Bitcoin has increased by yet another 10 percent from $3.5 billion to around $3.8 billion. On October 28, the volume of Bitcoin increased by around 20 percent from $3.1 billion to $3.5 billion, showing strong and sustainable momentum in the lower region of $6,000 for the first time since mid-September. Still Low Volume, But What Happened in November? As cryptocurrency investor and technical analyst Hsaka recently stated, the volume of Bitcoin has declined to the October 2017 level. Trading activity in the cryptocurrency exchange market has subsided due to the stagnant price movement of major cryptocurrencies. The decline in momentum of Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, Bitcoin Cash, and EOS have affected the performance of small market cap tokens and digital assets. But, in October, a drop in daily trading volume and a stagnant few months led to a short-term surge in price for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other major cryptocurrencies, allowing the market to achieve a valuation of $800 billion. Since August 9, the price of Bitcoin failed to escape a tight range from $6,300 to $6,600 apart from one occasion in mid-September, and an increase in volatility in the weeks to come could enable the market to achieve positive sentiment prior to the end of 2018. “If you squint hard enough, you can see the $BTC weekly candle. $85 spread between the high and low of the week (as of now). Last time we had lesser volume than this was Oct ’17. Hopefully we see some semblance of volatility into the weekly close,” Hsaka wrote. DonAlt, a cryptocurrency trader, stated that in the days to come, Bitcoin will likely retest $6,200, as it fell below its support level at $6,400. “Finally a movement. And as I guessed right as I’m about to leave for vacation, as always. Looking for a daily close at the edge of the green zone. Intraday a retest of 6200 still very possible.” BCH, XRP, and ETH Down 4% Heavily impacted by the two percent drop in the price of BTC over the past three hours, Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Ripple (XRP), and Ethereum (ETH) declined by more than 4 percent, recording a steep decline for the first time since early October. BCH and EOS recorded a more intense drop in comparison to other major cryptocurrencies, as the two assets often reflect the movement of small cryptocurrencies and tokens during a market downtrend. While the state of the market depends on the speed of the recovery of BTC, analysts generally believe that the crypto market will initiate a fast corrective rally in the days to come, particularly because the sell-off of major assets were triggered without a large spike in volume. The sell-pressure on most digital assets remain less intense than in August and September, which could allow the market to rebound relatively quickly in the short-term.

The Exodus 1 is sold at around $975 based on the current price of Bitcoin at $6,500. However, as the price of BTC rises, the price of the phone will also increase substantially. BTC was valued at $10,000 less than four months ago, and if BTC reaches the $10,000 resistance level in the months to come, the value of the Exodus 1 could surge to $1,500. Why Pegged to BTC and ETH? The primary feature of the Exodus 1 is its security. It has been developed to operate as a hardware cryptocurrency wallet, allowing users to safely store digital assets in the local wallet of the phone. In July, Samsung, the largest electronics manufacturer in Asia, revealed that mobile phones are significantly more secure in processing cryptocurrency payments than alternative devices and platforms such as desktop and the web because of the existence of a trusted ecosystem called the Trusted Execution Environment (TEE). With TEE in place, which operates as a separate execution environment with its own memory and storage, it is not possible for hackers to breach into protected information stored within the TEE ecosystem in the event of a hacking attack or a security breach. “This is why smartphones have an edge over laptops and desktops for cryptocurrency wallets: without the benefits of the hardware-based TEE, the keys are more vulnerable. There is a significant caveat: a naïve wallet developer might choose to simply store the keys on the normal internal storage of the phone, in which case there’s little additional protection from using the smartphone platform,” Joel Snyder, a senior IT consultant at Samsung Insights, explained. Exodus 1 of HTC leverages this ecosystem along with several other security features in a mobile phone to create a secure environment for cryptocurrency users. In regards to the decision of the company to sell the device exclusively in crypto with price pegged to BTC and ETH, Phil Chen, head of HTC’s blockchain initiative, told Hong Kong-based mainstream publication SCMP said that the company only intends to sell the device to the core audience that is the global blockchain community. “Selling it in crypto only and being the first to do so means we are bringing this directly to the core audience and those who will want this device – the blockchain community. It reflects our belief in cryptocurrencies – in fact we had to recreate and overcome many processes internally, as well as find new distributors, so that we can achieve the goal of only accepting cryptocurrencies as the form of payment.” Price Change In the months to come, if the price of BTC and ETH rise or decline by a large margin, HTC is expected to adjust the price of its mobile phone to maintain a realistic price tag which its consumer base can afford.

      "While much of the world grapples with the development of crypto-related policy, Ukraine has become a first mover. The eastern European country has unveiled a path for the adoption of cryptocurrencies, with Ukraine’s Ministry of Economic Development and Trade beginning the process for the legalization of virtual assets, an endeavor that is projected to take three years. According to the announcement: “The Economic Development Ministry initiates the adoption of the concept of state policy in the field of virtual assets, the purpose of which is to create understandable conditions for conducting activities in the field of virtual assets and virtual currencies.” The government organization will set out to define key terms in the crypto space, including “virtual currency/cryptocurrency, virtual assets, ICO/ITO, mining, smart contracts and token,” according to local Ukrainian publication Ukrinform. In doing so, they will be giving developers and blockchain founders parameters for operating in the space, including the tens of thousands of crypto engineers that are engaged by Silicon Valley startups. It could also bolster the amount of international investment that is directed into Ukrainian blockchain startups. Crypto policy will be crafted over two stages that will unfold between now and 2021. Fits and Starts There have been greens shoots of crypto regulation in Ukraine for months, with one member of Parliament, Alexei Mushak, revealing in the spring that the path to the legalization of cryptocurrencies was in the works and at that time urging feedback from market participants. Mushak, who made the announcement on Facebook, held BTC as of 2016, according to public forums. Ukraine Drafts Law to Legalize Cryptocurrencies, Fuels Debate In Crypto Community https://t.co/Sg7tUis7vj — CCN (@CryptoCoinsNews) May 17, 2018 Mushak said at the time that the country was looking to establish transparency in the market, one in which blockchain development would be nurtured across sectors of the economy while holders of crypto would be protected from “unsubstantiated criminal prosecutions.” Meanwhile, the law will also be designed to fight fraud such as “money laundering and terrorism financing” that tends to be associated with an “underground” crypto market that was common in Ukraine under a different administration. Regulatory clarity remains elusive in the blockchain space, and Ukraine is ahead of many jurisdictions in its efforts. Separately, there are a couple of crypto-friendly bills being considered, one of which would lift taxes on crypto-related business for at least a decade, incentivizing both businesses and individuals to transact in cryptocurrencies. Ukrainians trade nearly $2 million in cryptocurrencies daily across approximately two-dozen coins, and hundreds of local merchants already accept altcoins as a payment method.

      "A 23-year-old woman has been arrested by the Sydney police for stealing $65,000 worth cryptocurrencies from a 56-year-old man. Brisbane Times reported that the woman hacked the victim’s email account in January 2018. She used the two-step verification feature by changing the password and verifying it with her mobile number. She then sent 100,00 XRP to her account in China from the crypto accounts connected to the email account. The XRP were converted into Bitcoins and transferred to multiple e-wallets. The victim was able to acquire his account after two days, however, the woman had drained all his funds by that time. Arthur Katsogiannis, Cybercrime Squad commander, said, “It’s a very significant crime and it’s the first we know of its type in Australia where an individual has been arrested and charged for the technology-enabled theft of cryptocurrency.” Katsogiannis said that even though this crime is the first of its kind, it will become a norm in the coming years. He added that such incidents will prove to be dangerous for investors interested in cryptocurrencies. news.com.au reported that the Public Order and Riot Squad (PORS) caught the woman at her parent’s house in Ebbing and seized all of her electronic devices. The woman is set to appear at Burwood Local Court on November 19. Crypto Crimes Continue to Haunt Authorities Last month, Oklahoma police arrested two men for allegedly stealing $14 million worth CMCT tokens from blockchain-based IT company Crowd Machine. The men got hold of the victim’s SIM card and replaced it with a fake one to use the former to access the crypto wallet. In September 2018, Japanese crypto exchange Zaif lost 6.7 billion yen ($60 million) worth cryptocurrencies stored in hot wallets. This hack bore a resemblance to crypto exchange Coincheck’s hacking incident earlier this year. The exchange lost $530 million worth NEM stored in hot wallets, while the funds stored in cold wallets remained safe. Following the hack, the Financial Services Agency (FSA) of Japan sent business improvement orders to 6 crypto exchanges including Zaif. Japan’s National Police Agency (NPA) recently published a report which explained that 158 crypto crimes were reported in the first half of 2018 alone. The agency added that 60% of these cases occurred due to the use of similar account and password details in various online accounts. With a total of 60 billion yen (approximately $534 million) stolen this year, XRP and BTC are considered the most targeted cryptocurrencies. Featured image from Shutterstock.\n",

      "Throughout the past ten days, the Bitcoin price has remained in a tight range from $6,300 to $6,500, rarely initiating a noticeable movement. The 1-day price chart of Bitcoin, as shown below, demonstrates nearly two weeks of stability in the lower price range of the dominant cryptocurrency, unable to engage in a short-term upside movement to confirm a breakout above a major resistance level. In the past 24 hours, the volume of BTC has fallen back to $3.1 billion from $3.5 billion, by more than 10 percent. The lack of trading activity in the cryptocurrency exchange market can be attributed to the tendency of traders to prevent the initiation of high-risk and high-return trades in a period of extended stability and low volatility. Breakout Expected According to prominent cryptocurrency trader and technical analyst Peter Brandt, the price trend of BTC throughout the past ten days demonstrates a classic Wyckoff hinge, which suggests that buyers are in control in the market that has been dominated by bears and sellers since early 2018. “Wyckoff would classify these past 10 days as classic hinge behavior,” Brandt said. However, for the hinge to materialize, an abrupt increase in the price of Bitcoin to the $6,800 to $7,000 range to breakout of the $6,800 resistance level is required, which traders are observing at this time. Due to the low volume and trading activity of the cryptocurrency exchange market, a sudden breakout of Bitcoin in a higher price range is becoming increasingly unlikely, at least in the short-term. As for technical indicators and minor price movements of Bitcoin, since August 9, the asset has barely made any movement outside of the $6,300 to $6,800 range, portraying the lowest rate of volatility in recent years. Often, the stability in the price of BTC leads to an increase in value of small market cap cryptocurrencies and tokens. But, the low volume of the crypto market has prevented traders from engaging in risky trades in a market that is highly unpredictable. Most tokens including Wanchain, Golem, Funfair, Aelf, and Zilliqa have made 2 to 8 percent gains across the board over the last 24 hours. Positive Development Out of China Throughout the past several months, with the imposition of a ban on Alipay in settling cryptocurrency-related transactions, the government of China has cracked down on the crypto market, strengthening the existing blanket ban on the asset class. On October 26, CnLedger, a trusted cryptocurrency source in China, reported that a local court ruled Bitcoin to be a property and protected under law, reaffirming the legality of owning and holding BTC. “Chinese court confirms Bitcoin is protected by law. Shenzhen Court of International Arbitration ruled a case involving cryptos. Inside the verdict: China law does not forbid owning & transferring bitcoin, which should be protected by law because of its property nature and economic value.” While the ruling of the court does not change the inability of investors in China to legally invest in BTC, it is possible to rely on over-the-counter (OTC) markets to purchase crypto and hold onto them.

      "Over the past 11 days, the Bitcoin price has remained stable in the range of $6,300 to $6,500, struggling to initiate a major movement on the upside. The volume of Bitcoin has declined substantially over the last 72 hours from $3.6 billion to $3.1 billion on CoinMarketCap, by nearly 20 percent. Trading activity in the cryptocurrency exchange market has generally subsided, as investors have started to avoid taking high-risk, high-return trades in a period of uncertainty. Support and Resistance Merging: Where is Bitcoin Headed to Next? Since early August, for nearly three months, Bitcoin has shown a record high level of stability. The dominant cryptocurrency has not seen such a low level of volatility spread out across several months in recent history, even during the aftermath of the 2014 correction. Bitcoin has stabilized in the lower price range to the point in which its support and resistance levels started to merge. Previously, respected cryptocurrency trader Peter Brandt stated that the short-term price trend of Bitcoin can be considered as a classic Wyckoff hinge behavior, which could lead to a major short-term rally for the asset. However, Willy Woo, a prominent cryptocurrency analyst and operator of Woobull.com, stated that based on various technical indicators including the NVT Ratio, the cryptocurrency market is likely to be in the middle of a long-lasting bear market. “If you’re into timing games, then my own NVT Ratio is saying we are still in the middle of a bear market. NVT is simply the ratio of volume carried by the blockchain to the historic price. (This indicator is due for recalibration after the Liquid Sidechain launch). Woo added that the correlation between network volume and market cap of major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin could serve as an accurate indicator to measure the depth of the current bear market, referring to the NVT chart published on Woobull.com below. “This is the chart that NVT is based upon; the historically tight correlation between the value transmitted by the chain (network volume) and network value (market cap). The deviation we are going through right now are clues to how much of a bear market we are in.” If the cryptocurrency market is in fact in the midst of a long-lasting bear market, it does not mean that a large drop is in play. It is possible for BTC to demonstrate another substantial drop in the long-term but given the level of stability it has demonstrated throughout the past three months, a drop below the $6,000 support level is highly unlikely. Where is Bitcoin Headed to? In the days to come, the price of Bitcoin is expected to remain in the tight range of $6,400 to $6,500 due to its low volume. But, a major catalyst could send the price of the asset up to the $6,800 mark, a major resistance level which the asset has not been able to test since September. Featured Image from Shutterstock.

      "Its an important day for HTC. The companys Android smartphones, once touted as among the best around (theyre still pretty good), havent been selling very well in recent years. But HTC is reinventing itself with a new device, that fully jumps onto the hottest trend in technology: the blockchain. Starting today, HTC is accepting pre-orders for the Exodus 1, an \"early access\" version of the previously announced Exodus device. In smartphone terms, the Exodus 1 a pretty powerful phone, in line with the top flagships of today. Its got a 6-inch Quad HD display with 18:9 aspect ratio, a dual, 16-megapixel back camera and a dual, 8-megapixel selfie camera. Its powered by a Snapdragon 845 processor, and its got 6GB of RAM, 128GB of storage, a 3,500mAh battery and IP68 dust/waterproof rating. Its only weak point, specs-wise, is the fact that its running Android Oreo and not Android Pie. We dont know much about the design, beyond the render (below) which indicates that the phone might have a see-through back, similar to the design of the HTC U12+. Image: HTC More interesting than the specs are the phones blockchain-related capabilities. First, it comes with a \"secure enclave,\" which HTC describes as a \"locked area on the device that is protected from the Android OS.\" This is where you hold your cryptocurrency private keys; ideally, even if your phones security gets compromised in some ways, the private keys in the secure enclave should remain safe. HTCs Decentralized Chief Officer (yes, thats a real title), Phil Chen, told me via e-mail that the secure enclave is not a separate chip. Instead, its utilizing ARMs TrustZone tech, which is typically used for payment, authentication and content protection. This is \"the first time anyone has given access to the TrustZone to the people,\" Chen told me. The phone also has an interesting way of retrieving your private keys even if your phone is lost in stolen. It involves picking a few trustworthy contacts, each of whom must download an app. Then, your private keys seed is split using a secret sharing algorithm (based on a well-known cryptography concept called Shamirs Secret Sharing, Chen confirmed to me), with each part sent to your contacts. None of them can retrieve the key on their own, but you can retrieve the key by combining all the parts. Another advantage of this approach is that your key is sort of in the cloud, but its not stored in any central location and certainly not on HTCs servers. HTC will release APIs for third party developers to create apps that work with the Exodus 1 hardware. The phone will also come with pre-installed, blockchain-related apps, but Chen says the specifics of that will be revealed at a later stage. Ive asked Chen about the \"Exodus 1\" moniker, and the companys \"early access\" language, which makes the device sound like an early version of something. \"This is a 1.0 version,\" Chen told me. \"The problem we’re solving is obviously very complicated and there’s a reason no one has managed to do it yet. Namely, giving tools to the people to own their own keys and also when they lose they their phone, the ability to recover it. We need the help of the community to harden our wallet and make it more secure. The crypto internet is still in its infant stages, the Exodus is the first attempt to lay the foundation for that internet. And the first step is to empower and educate the consumer to own their own keys.\" he said. As for the companys original announcement that each Exodus phone will allow users to run a cryptocurrency node, Chen also says this will be added in a \"later stage.\" The HTC Exodus 1 can be pre-ordered at www.htcexodus.com in 34 countries, including the U.S., Taiwan, HK, Singapore, New Zealand, UK, Austria, Norway and \"other European countries.\" It ships in December. In true blockchain style, HTC is pricing the phone in Ethereum and Bitcoin. You will be able to buy it with those two coins, at a price of 0.15 BTC or 4.78 ETH. Thats roughly $960 at the time of writing, but given cryptos volatility, it might be a considerably different number at publish time.

      "Over the past 24 hours, the crypto market has added $2 billion to its valuation, rising to $210 billion. The Bitcoin price has experienced a slight increase in price from $6,370 to $6,430, supported by a minor rise in daily trading volume. Still, the volume of the cryptocurrency exchange market remains weak, with the daily trading volume of Bitcoin remaining below $3.5 billion on Coinmarketcap and $2.42 billion on CoinCap. XRP, the native currency of the Ripple blockchain protocol, has surged by around 3 percent on October 24, possibly due to the approval of Coinbase Custody by the New York Department of Financial Services to operate as a regulated custodian facilitating investments in Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Ripple, and Litecoin. “Coinbase Custody Trust Company will operate as a standalone, independently-capitalized business to Coinbase Inc. and will be held to the same compliance, security and capital requirements as traditional fiduciary custodial businesses like the DTC,” Coinbase Custody product lead Sam McIngvale said. Same Trend For Months Since August, the price trend of Bitcoin has remained in the range of $6,300 to $6,800, failing to break out of the $6,800 resistance level apart from one occasion in mid-September. As such, technical analyst DonAlt stated that in a period of stability, rather than initiating high risk trades, it is safer to observe the market and the short-term price trend of Bitcoin. “Updating the daily chart doesn’t really make much sense, it’s been the same thing for days now. That’s why you get the 4H chart with the zones I’m watching. Before any of these anything but longing S and shorting R makes little sense.” Most traders in the cryptocurrency community echoed a similar sentiment, emphasizing that until the dominant cryptocurrency engages in a major price movement on the downside and the upside, it will be difficult for traders to predict the trend of the market. “Look for longs in the lower 1/3 of the range and shorts in the upper 1/3 of the range. Rinse and repeat until it doesn’t work any more. It really can be that easy,” cryptocurrency trader Mayne said. In previous weeks, when the price of Bitcoin made a move near the $6,700 to $6,800 range, the volume of the asset increased to around $4 billion, which it held relatively well throughout August and September. Yet, over the past two weeks, BTC has struggled to see an increase in its volume, remaining below the $3.5 billion mark. Where the Market Goes Next Investors expect the prices of major cryptocurrencies to increase in the months to come, particularly in December, as interest towards the Bakkt BTC futures market rise prior to its launch. In terms of market development and infrastructure strengthening, the cryptocurrency market is in an ideal position to initiate a short-term rally, supported by the months of stability demonstrated by BTC. Still, due to the lack of momentum and trading activity in the market, the trend of major digital assets remains uncertain. Featured Image from Shutterstock. Charts from TradingView.\n",

      "At a meeting with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) commissioner Elad L. Roisman, representatives from SolidX, VanEck, and CBOE presented five major reasons why the commission should approve the Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) filing of VanEck and SolidX. VanEck, an investment management firm headquartered in New York that has decades of track record in the traditional finance sector and hundreds of ETFs filed under its name, outlined the following points the SEC should consider in approving its Bitcoin ETF: There now exists a significant regulated derivatives market for bitcoin Relevant markets – CBOE, bitcoin futures, OTC desks – are regulated Concerns around price manipulation have been mitigated, consistent with approval of prior commodity-based ETPs CBOE’s rules are designed to surveil for potential manipulation of Trust shares Promotes investor protection Significant Volume and Trading Activity in the Futures Market Previously, the SEC rejected the Winklevoss Bitcoin ETF primarily due to its reliance on a public cryptocurrency exchange in Gemini to find the base price of BTC. The SEC deemed cryptocurrency exchanges to be insufficiently regulated and liquid to handle an ETF. As a response to the rejection of the Winklevoss Bitcoin ETF, ProShares and two other companies filed 9 ETFs, basing the BTC price of the ETFs on the futures market operated by CBOE and CME Group. At the time, the filling of ETFs by the three companies was considered a smart move as it considered the SEC’s concerns regarding cryptocurrency exchanges. However, the SEC rejected the 9 ETFs and stated that the futures market is not of significant size to support an ETF. During its presentation, VanEck, SolidX, and CBOE representatives told the SEC that the futures market is able to handle the operation of an ETF through the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC), which was especially relevant given the involvement of CBOE in the filing. VanEck also emphasized that the approval of an ETF would reduce counterparty risk for investors and it would provide a simple solution for investors seeking price exposure, by increasing the stability of the market. “As of now, no CCPs support the clearing of bitcoin Investors are left facing absolute counterparty risk. Such risks are often unacceptable to many investors An ETF provides a straightforward solution for investors seeking price exposure without facing counterparty risk, as the ETF would be cleared through DTCC Furthermore, in creations and redemptions, the Trust always requires APs and trading counterparties to settle their leg of the trade before the Trust will do so.” The claim of VanEck directly supports the statement of SEC commissioner Hester Peirce, who previously stated that the current structure of the cryptocurrency exchange market only allows a selected group of investors with specific know-how and knowledge in the market to trade and benefit off of the liquidity in the market. “This complexity means that only a very particular type of investor can pursue the diversification opportunities such assets can provide. Entrepreneurs are developing new products through which people can access cryptocurrencies indirectly or hedge their cryptocurrency holdings. Bitcoin futures, for example, began to trade recently,” she explained. VanEck Has the Highest Chance Throughout the past several months, analysts have given VanEck and SolidX the strongest chance of having an ETF introduced in US markets given the history of VanEck in successfully filing hundreds of ETFs with the SEC.

      "A documentary film that profiles distributed ledger technology and counts an Ethereum co-founder as one of its executive producers had its theatrical release on October 26 in New York. Written and directed by Alex Winter, Trust Machine: The Story of Blockchain, runs for 84 minutes and covers subjects ranging from the history of Bitcoin to the promising use cases of distributed ledger technology. Joseph Lubin, the co-founder of Ethereum as well as the founder of blockchain software technology firm ConsenSys, is one of the film’s executive producers. Regarding Bitcoin’s history, the film credits the 2008 global financial crisis as the reason that triggered the mysterious Satoshi Nakamoto to develop an open, decentralized ledger for transactions. Not everything turned out perfectly, however, and the documentary laments that BTC initially became famous for its use in illicit deals on the internet and alleges that this, unfortunately, earned the flagship cryptocurrency a perception and a reputation that it is still trying to shake off. Good for Newbies Critics have pointed out that the doc serves as a useful primer anyone is unfamiliar with blockchain technology. As The New York Times film critic Ben Kenigsberg writes, the film serves as a solid teaching aid: “A hodgepodge of boosterish arguments for blockchain technology, ‘Trust Machine: The Story of Blockchain,’ directed by Alex Winter (Bill of “Bill & Ted” fame), is not always a model of clarity, but it does a decent job of explaining the basic concept.” Some of the contributions that blockchain technology can make to the world that the documentary film focuses on include combating identity theft and transforming power distribution by empowering micro-producers of power such as households who are able to generate solar power and sell the excess to the grid. Ticket to Riches But, for all the revolutionary potential of blockchain technology, Winter’s film concedes that what is drawing most people to cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology is the desire to strike it rich. “Still, for most people in the world right now, the most exciting thing about blockchain is the prospect of making a fortune overnight,” notes The Hollywood Reporter. “In its closing scenes, the film’s narration acknowledges how attractive this field is to scammers and speculators.” As previously reported by CCN, this is not the first documentary Alex Winter has directed focusing on cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. Three years ago, the actor-turned-director made a 90-minute film Deep Web, which documented the arrest of Silk Road marketplace webmaster Ross Ulbricht. The film was narrated by Keanu Reeves.

CCN does not endorse, nor is responsible for any material included below and isn’t responsible for any damages or losses connected with any products or services mentioned in the press release. CCN urges readers to conduct their own research with due diligence into the company, product or service mentioned in the press release. Available now on Android and iOS, the free app offers cryptocurrency holders a better user experience, with virtual financial asset banking, transfer, investment, and more. QORMI, MALTA (Oct. 15, 2018) — Noomi Wallet, a brand new, cryptocurrency banking application developed by a dedicated team of blockchain experts, officially launched today for Android and iOS devices. The digital wallet, which aims to make cryptocurrency in everyday life a mainstream reality, is designed to be both practical and easy to use. Serious crypto investors now have a place they can invest their virtual financial assets, or VFAs, in high-yield Bitcoin and Ethereum accounts. And thanks to the streamlined user interface, it’s the perfect app for crypto fans to introduce their family, friends, and associates — i.e. those who may not be as familiar with or comfortable using crypto — to the emerging world of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other VFAs. Among the core features: Invest and grow your VFAs — Open a Bitcoin or Ethereum investment account with fixed, guaranteed APRs. Support for all your VFAs — Noomi already supports some of the world’s most popular cryptocurrencies, which you can store safely in this easy-to-use wallet. These include Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH) and ERC20 tokens, CyberMiles Token (CMT), and more to come. Instant and free transfers and withdrawals — Instantly transfer VFAs to your friends on Noomi for free. W allet staking (coming soon) — Noomi is the first—and only—way for people who don’t have CMT cubes to participate still in block rewards and staking. These features offer immediate value to users and are the first part of an overall vision of building a compelling VFA services solution for the blockchain ecosystem: “Cryptocurrency is giving rise to new ways of interacting with money and commerce,” Andrew Dao, CEO of Noomi said. “There are countless promising new blockchains and tokens being launched that strive to innovate entire industries, unlock new value for users, and create something better and unique. We believe the innovation and creativity of this blockchain-based ecosystem will evolve the way business, commerce, and finance is done, a change that cannot happen overnight.” In addition to its primary VFA banking and payment transfer functions, Noomi sets itself further apart from other crypto wallets on the market by: Empowering users to invest their BTC and ETH like fiat. Noomi works with VFA managers to let users deposit VFAs into investment accounts, with guaranteed returns, great rates (6-10 percent p.a.), and short investment periods (14-30 days). Enabling usernames that you can remember. In addition to a standard wallet address, all Noomi users can choose a unique username for themselves and share that name with other users so that they can send or request cryptocurrency from you instantly. Erasing gas fees. Within the Noomi network, users can send cryptocurrency to each other instantly and for free. When sending outside the Noomi network, Noomi will pay the gas fee* for the supported VFAs. Eliminating the need to have a separate wallet app for different cryptocurrencies. Store and manage all of them in the Noomi Wallet, it’s as simple as that. Furthermore, Noomi’s team is in the process of applying for the Malta government-issued license to store, transfer and manage VFAs, making it one of the first crypto wallets in the world in full compliance with Malta VFA laws and regulations. “Our goal for Noomi is not only to support a new blockchain ecosystem, but also to assist the transition from traditional to blockchain-based practices by providing the critical layers of banking, payment processing, and investment services that tie it all together,” Dao said. “Moreover, we’re doing it in a way that benefits the people and businesses who are pioneers in this change. This app of ours is the first step.” Noomi has partnered with CyberMiles, a new public blockchain for e-commerce, as part of the CyberMiles ecosystem. Noomi is one of more than two dozen “Supernode” candidates for the CyberMiles’ blockchain, which is set for release this week. This strategic move is intended to position Noomi as not only a leader in the VFA services space but also a critical link in the DPoS consensus protocol that will power the CyberMiles network. “Till now, blockchain technology has been geared largely toward technical advancements or improvements like public ledgers and smart contracts,” Dr. Lucas Lu, founder, and CEO of the CyberMiles Foundation said. “While more and more people hear about cryptocurrency every day, few of us actually own it. Its potential to revolutionize how we pay, share information, and even how we interact with each other is yet to be realized. Expanding our ecosystem, we’re confident about paving the way for regular consumers to experience the benefits of cryptocurrency like never before.” Noomi already has undergone a professional security audit to ensure the safety of the VFAs held by the wallet and the users’ personal information. To learn more about the Noomi Wallet, go to noomiwallet.com, or join Noomi’s Telegram community at t.me/noomiofficial. *For a limited time only, Noomi is offering zero gas fees on any ERC20 token transaction from a Noomi user to a non-Noomi user. While CMT will be included as well, ETH and BTC transactions do not qualify for this promotional period. About Noomi Wallet Noomi was created to make virtual financial asset management and investment easy, secure, and most importantly, profitable. Our team of blockchain experts have banded together to build the best-in-class virtual financial asset investment and management platform that combines the traditional wallet with investment features to help you earn more no matter how the market is performing. Building on our team’s experience partnering with successful blockchain projects, we are offering an innovative new way for users to manage their virtual financial assets.

      "This is a paid-for submitted press release. CCN does not endorse, nor is responsible for any material included below and isn’t responsible for any damages or losses connected with any products or services mentioned in the press release. CCN urges readers to conduct their own research with due diligence into the company, product or service mentioned in the press release. Cryptocurrencies, while efficient and highly functional in their interactions with one and other in virtual space, suffer from slow, complicated, and sometimes expensive transition to and from the realms of fiat currency and general consumer transactions. These transitions are generally accomplished via cryptocurrency exchanges and funneled through conventional third-party central ledger systems (banks and conventional credit card systems). Third party central ledger systems impose the limitations of conventional banks on these transactions negating most of the benefits otherwise afforded by cryptocurrencies. Such a system is analogous to having high-speed broadband data services which terminate at the local post office, are converted to physical storage media, and then finish the journey by conventional mail. These structural deficiencies are further compounded by access barriers at the exchange level, which frequently require the establishment of trading accounts with distant and unfamiliar exchange organizations, using, what is to many consumers, confusing interfaces and terminology, followed by a cumbersome self-identification process to comply with remote KYC and AML procedures. Finally, repatriation or reconversion to local fiat currency, or into some other format usable for local consumer transactions often requires the use of extant local banking systems. Beyond the previously discussed impairments to speed and efficiency, this eliminates an entire subset of the population from participation. For example, in the United States, the world’s biggest consumer market with the largest amount of cash turnover, at least 8% of 115 million households do not have banking accounts a result of preference or insufficient personal credit. In an interview at the annual tech conference TechCrunch Disrupt, Coinbase CEO Armstrong predicted participants in cryptoverse to increase from 40 million to 1 billion people, an increase of 2,400 percent, over the next five years. Now the Market cap of crypto is $211 billion. Satis Group, а well-known a cryptocurrency advisory firm, this September predicted a total crypto market capitalization of $509 billion for next year and estimates that the market cap will break above $1 trillion in 2021. Their report also estimates that BTC will be trading at $32,914 during next year, $96,378 in five years time, and $143,900 in 2028. The KrypNet provides a solution to these issues by the development and integrated deployment of six main elements: KrypATM, KrypExchange, KrypCard, KrypCredit, KrypWallet, and KrypFunding. Operating as a unified and multifunctional system, they will allow the KrypNet to bypass most of the deficiencies facing existing cryptocurrency systems. Since 2014, the company has been working with terminals and ATMs, and succeeded in establishing a network of about 400 machines in the United States. Based on this experience, KrypNet decided to expand its business into the crypto industry. At this point, a software platform for the complete process of buying and selling cryptoassets was developed, along with the option to instantly issue a debit card using the terminal. Currently, our company is continuing to develop KrypATM platform and preparing crypto projects in the US, Kyrgyzstan, Grenada, Philippines, Panama, Mongolia, and Russia. In a few years KrypNet will install more than 60,000 KrypATMs globally which along with our mobile applications will give the following options: Allow consumers to directly open cryptocurrency accounts and their personal virtual repository of cryptocurrency in the form of KrypWallets Provide consumers with convenient physical access “in their corner store” to KrypNet outputs (such as instantly dispensed physical cash and KrypCards). Ultimately access liquidity assistance via the KrypCredit offerings KrypNet is an infrastructural project. One of its most important goals is to create a simple system for exchanging coins to Fiat through a global network of KrypATM. Taken together, the KrypNet Project will eliminate most of the barriers to entry to cryptocurrency transactions for the general public, and will provide convenience in the forms of speed, flexibility, and reduced transaction fees to this population. This will dramatically incentivize the adoption of cryptocurrency for everyday consumer and household transactions. By creating superior debit and credit mechanisms, the KrypNet provides a practical answer to the “why should I use x-coin” question for consumers. By leveraging the inevitable economies of scale, the KrypNet will finally allow cryptocurrencies to deliver on their extraordinary promise.\n",

      "Data from the Bank of Canada and the Ontario Securities Commission has revealed that bitcoin adoption and general crypto awareness in Canada is growing steadily, with the percentage of Canadian poll respondents who own bitcoin rising from 2.9 percent in 2016 to 5 percent in 2017. According to a recently released report by the Bank of Canada titled “Bitcoin Awareness and Usage in Canada: An Update,” Canadians between the ages of 45 and 54 were the group that reported the largest growth in bitcoin ownership over the period, multiplying nearly four times from 0.9 percent in 2016 to 3.5 percent in 2017. Similarly, an OSC report shows that about 1 in 10 Ontarians either currently hold or used to hold cryptoassets. Data Breakdown The Bank of Canada report shows that the gender gap for bitcoin ownership widened considerably over the period in question, with female bitcoin owners in Canada remaining at 2 percent of the population, while the male bitcoin ownership figure nearly doubled, jumping from 4.2 percent to 8.1 percent. Significantly, ownership did not only grow in heavily populated provinces with urban centres like Ontario and British Columbia but grew across all provinces including Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and Alberta. It also showed that the number of holders of small bitcoin amounts has increased by a wider margin than that of people holding more than 10 BTC. The OSC’s data estimates the total number of Ontario residents holding cryptoassets at 500,000 by extrapolating the sample respondents to the population of the entire province. Of these, 63 percent say they own bitcoin, followed by 35 percent for ether, 18 percent for litecoin, 17 percent for bitcoin cash, and 13 percent for ripple (XRP). Very significantly, the report was able to ascertain from respondents when they first purchased their crypto holdings, which revealed that, unsurprisingly, a large percentage purchased their first coins in late 2017 or early 2018. According to the survey, which was conducted in March 2018, 35 percent of crypto holders reported having made their first purchase of cryptocurrency within the previous three months, and a further 37 percent say they first obtained crypto within the past year. Just 27 percent indicated having purchased their crypto more than a year ago, which means that 72 percent of crypto holders in Ontario have bought in over the past one year. This tells a significant story about the growth of crypto adoption in Canada’s most populated province. As cryptocurrencies continue to grow in popularity and spread across Canada, regulators are also keeping an eye on the new opportunities and threats presented in the country, which was recently described as “more blockchain-friendly than the US.” CCN reported in May that Canadian and American regulators are collaborating on a joint cross-border operation targeting ICO and cryptocurrency scams called “Operation Cryptosweep.” Featured Image from Shutterstock\n",

      "Cryptocurrency mining firm Bitfury is considering an initial public offering in Amsterdam or London as early as 2019. The move would make Bitfury the first major crypto IPO listed in Europe. The Amsterdam-based blockchain startup could seek a valuation of $3 billion to $5 billion, sources told Bloomberg. The company is speaking with several investment banks to explore its options, including debuting on a Hong Kong exchange. No final decisions have been made. Bitfury has been making key moves to expand its business, even as the cryptocurrency market remains sluggish. Bitfury Rival Recently Launched IPO Bitfury, which launched in 2011 as a bitcoin mining company and maker of crypto-mining gear, has since expanded into blockchain research. It expects to report revenue of $450 million for the last fiscal year. Last month, Bitfury rolled out a new SHA256 application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) chip that can achieve a hashrate of 120GH/s with a power efficiency of 55mW/GH. Two days later, Bitfury’s much-larger rival — Bitmain Technologies — unveiled a new 7nm ASIC mining chip for the SHA256 algorithm used by bitcoin, bitcoin cash, and other virtual currencies, as CCN has reported. With its proposed IPO, Bitfury is following in the footsteps of Bitmain — the world’s most valuable cryptocurrency company. In September 2018, Bitmain filed for an initial public offering in Hong Kong with a potential valuation of up to $3 billion. CNBC Analyst: Coinbase Mulls IPO Meanwhile, Coinbase, the largest U.S. cryptocurrency exchange, may be preparing to go public, as CCN has reported. Crypto analyst Ryan NeuNer, who hosts the show “CryptoTrader” on CNBC South Africa, promised to reveal details of Coinbase’s purported IPO soon. CNBC Cryptotrader exposes details of the Coinbase IPO raise tomorrow on a Cryptotrader exclusive. pic.twitter.com/YG4UOP3ju8 — Ran NeuNer (@cryptomanran) October 25, 2018 “I guess it’s big news!” NeuNer boasted on Twitter. I guess it’s big news! pic.twitter.com/3RqYxkvGXf — Ran NeuNer (@cryptomanran) October 26, 2018 As CCN has reported, NeuNer recently predicted that bitcoin prices were “about to explode,” citing bullish market buzz about the near-term possibility of an SEC-approved bitcoin ETF. Since then, BTC prices have remained generally flat. In February 2018, Ran Neuner predicted that bitcoin prices would top $50,000 by the end of 2018. So far, that forecast appears unrealistic given current market conditions. For the record, I am pinning this tweet. Bitcoin will finish 2018 at $50 000. — Ran NeuNer (@cryptomanran) February 2, 2018 The traditional financial industry has slowly but gradually started recognizing cryptocurrencies as a viable asset class as its mainstream popularity continues to escalate. The lack of an established regulatory framework has been cited as a key reason for Wall Street’s hesitation in throwing its full support behind the burgeoning market. That said, there are signs that a sea change afoot. Fidelity Investments, whose assets under management tops $2 trillion, plans to launch a separate company to provide cryptocurrency custody and institutional trade-execution services. “Our goal is to make digitally-native assets, such as bitcoin, more accessible to investors,” Fidelity CEO Abigail Johnson said. “We expect to continue investing and experimenting, over the long-term, with ways to make this emerging asset class easier for our clients to understand and use.” Featured image from Shutterstock.\n",

      "Over the last 24 hours, the volume of Bitcoin has increased by yet another 10 percent from $3.5 billion to around $3.8 billion. On October 28, the volume of Bitcoin increased by around 20 percent from $3.1 billion to $3.5 billion, showing strong and sustainable momentum in the lower region of $6,000 for the first time since mid-September. Still Low Volume, But What Happened in November? As cryptocurrency investor and technical analyst Hsaka recently stated, the volume of Bitcoin has declined to the October 2017 level. Trading activity in the cryptocurrency exchange market has subsided due to the stagnant price movement of major cryptocurrencies. The decline in momentum of Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, Bitcoin Cash, and EOS have affected the performance of small market cap tokens and digital assets. But, in October, a drop in daily trading volume and a stagnant few months led to a short-term surge in price for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other major cryptocurrencies, allowing the market to achieve a valuation of $800 billion. Since August 9, the price of Bitcoin failed to escape a tight range from $6,300 to $6,600 apart from one occasion in mid-September, and an increase in volatility in the weeks to come could enable the market to achieve positive sentiment prior to the end of 2018. “If you squint hard enough, you can see the $BTC weekly candle. $85 spread between the high and low of the week (as of now). Last time we had lesser volume than this was Oct ’17. Hopefully we see some semblance of volatility into the weekly close,” Hsaka wrote. DonAlt, a cryptocurrency trader, stated that in the days to come, Bitcoin will likely retest $6,200, as it fell below its support level at $6,400. “Finally a movement. And as I guessed right as I’m about to leave for vacation, as always. Looking for a daily close at the edge of the green zone. Intraday a retest of 6200 still very possible.” BCH, XRP, and ETH Down 4% Heavily impacted by the two percent drop in the price of BTC over the past three hours, Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Ripple (XRP), and Ethereum (ETH) declined by more than 4 percent, recording a steep decline for the first time since early October. BCH and EOS recorded a more intense drop in comparison to other major cryptocurrencies, as the two assets often reflect the movement of small cryptocurrencies and tokens during a market downtrend. While the state of the market depends on the speed of the recovery of BTC, analysts generally believe that the crypto market will initiate a fast corrective rally in the days to come, particularly because the sell-off of major assets were triggered without a large spike in volume. The sell-pressure on most digital assets remain less intense than in August and September, which could allow the market to rebound relatively quickly in the short-term.

      "Taiwanese consumer electronics giant HTC has officially launched its first blockchain phone, which will be sold exclusively in crypto. Called Exodus 1, the blockchain mobile phone of HTC is available to consumers at a fixed price of 0.15 Bitcoin (ETC) and 4.78 Ethereum (ETH), nearing the price of the new iPhone XS that has a starting price of $999. The Exodus 1 is sold at around $975 based on the current price of Bitcoin at $6,500. However, as the price of BTC rises, the price of the phone will also increase substantially. BTC was valued at $10,000 less than four months ago, and if BTC reaches the $10,000 resistance level in the months to come, the value of the Exodus 1 could surge to $1,500. Why Pegged to BTC and ETH? The primary feature of the Exodus 1 is its security. It has been developed to operate as a hardware cryptocurrency wallet, allowing users to safely store digital assets in the local wallet of the phone. In July, Samsung, the largest electronics manufacturer in Asia, revealed that mobile phones are significantly more secure in processing cryptocurrency payments than alternative devices and platforms such as desktop and the web because of the existence of a trusted ecosystem called the Trusted Execution Environment (TEE). With TEE in place, which operates as a separate execution environment with its own memory and storage, it is not possible for hackers to breach into protected information stored within the TEE ecosystem in the event of a hacking attack or a security breach. “This is why smartphones have an edge over laptops and desktops for cryptocurrency wallets: without the benefits of the hardware-based TEE, the keys are more vulnerable. There is a significant caveat: a naïve wallet developer might choose to simply store the keys on the normal internal storage of the phone, in which case there’s little additional protection from using the smartphone platform,” Joel Snyder, a senior IT consultant at Samsung Insights, explained. Exodus 1 of HTC leverages this ecosystem along with several other security features in a mobile phone to create a secure environment for cryptocurrency users. In regards to the decision of the company to sell the device exclusively in crypto with price pegged to BTC and ETH, Phil Chen, head of HTC’s blockchain initiative, told Hong Kong-based mainstream publication SCMP said that the company only intends to sell the device to the core audience that is the global blockchain community. “Selling it in crypto only and being the first to do so means we are bringing this directly to the core audience and those who will want this device – the blockchain community. It reflects our belief in cryptocurrencies – in fact we had to recreate and overcome many processes internally, as well as find new distributors, so that we can achieve the goal of only accepting cryptocurrencies as the form of payment.” Price Change In the months to come, if the price of BTC and ETH rise or decline by a large margin, HTC is expected to adjust the price of its mobile phone to maintain a realistic price tag which its consumer base can afford.

      "It’s been 10 years since bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto published his white paper on bitcoin, and the global economy hasn’t been the same since. The original cryptocurrency now boasts a market cap of more than $112 billion, while bitcoin’s dominance hovers at more than 53%. But if you ask Nigel Green, founder and CEO of financial advisory firm deVere Group, which boasts $10 billion in AUM, the next 10 years will look a lot different than bitcoin’s first decade. He’s quick to attribute the “crypto revolution” to bitcoin, saying that it has changed the way money is transacted forever. Green’s outlook, however, is a mixed bag, with bitcoin’s “influence and dominance of the cryptocurrency sector” expected to “drastically reduce” while the value of the broader crypto market is poised to expand by 5,000%, which would attach a combined market cap of $20 trillion in the coming decade. Green stated in a press release: “[While] I don’t wish to rain on anyone’s parade, I believe that Bitcoin’s influence and dominance of the cryptocurrency sector will drastically reduce in its second decade. This is because as mass adoption of cryptocurrency grows, more and more digital assets will be launched – by organizations in both the private and the public sectors. This will increase competition for Bitcoin and dent its market share.” Ripple (XRP) and ETH to Steal Bitcoin’s Shine Green, whose firm is based in Dubai but has offices around the world, pointed to other reasons for the forecast, such as better technology, features, and solutions to problems that competing cryptocurrencies will provide, coins like ripple (XRP) and ethereum. He told CCN: “I believe that…XRP will be one of the main digital assets to dent Bitcoin’s market share over the next few years due to its apparent focus on integrating with banks and other financial institutions.” XRP already muscled ETH out of the No. 2 spot for cryptocurrencies on CoinMarketCap more than once this year, though it has since fallen back to the No. 3 spot. Meanwhile, despite the fact that ETH has fallen out of favor with the crypto community of late, Green remains bullish on the future though he falls short of calling for a “flippening” event. “Another one would be its current main challenger Ethereum. This is because a growing number of platforms are adopting Ethereum as a means of trading; there’s an increasing use of smart contracts by Ethereum; and due to the decentralization of cloud computing.” Even if bitcoin’s dominance fades, Green says there is a clear shift among retail and institutional investors away from fiat money and into crypto, one whose momentum will only intensify in the coming decade. As a result, he expects “the market will have grown beyond recognition when Bitcoin celebrates its 20th anniversary.” Featured Image from Shutterstock\n",

      "Its an important day for HTC. The companys Android smartphones, once touted as among the best around (theyre still pretty good), havent been selling very well in recent years. But HTC is reinventing itself with a new device, that fully jumps onto the hottest trend in technology: the blockchain. Starting today, HTC is accepting pre-orders for the Exodus 1, an \"early access\" version of the previously announced Exodus device. In smartphone terms, the Exodus 1 a pretty powerful phone, in line with the top flagships of today. Its got a 6-inch Quad HD display with 18:9 aspect ratio, a dual, 16-megapixel back camera and a dual, 8-megapixel selfie camera. Its powered by a Snapdragon 845 processor, and its got 6GB of RAM, 128GB of storage, a 3,500mAh battery and IP68 dust/waterproof rating. Its only weak point, specs-wise, is the fact that its running Android Oreo and not Android Pie. We dont know much about the design, beyond the render (below) which indicates that the phone might have a see-through back, similar to the design of the HTC U12+. Image: HTC More interesting than the specs are the phones blockchain-related capabilities. First, it comes with a \"secure enclave,\" which HTC describes as a \"locked area on the device that is protected from the Android OS.\" This is where you hold your cryptocurrency private keys; ideally, even if your phones security gets compromised in some ways, the private keys in the secure enclave should remain safe. HTCs Decentralized Chief Officer (yes, thats a real title), Phil Chen, told me via e-mail that the secure enclave is not a separate chip. Instead, its utilizing ARMs TrustZone tech, which is typically used for payment, authentication and content protection. This is \"the first time anyone has given access to the TrustZone to the people,\" Chen told me. The phone also has an interesting way of retrieving your private keys even if your phone is lost in stolen. It involves picking a few trustworthy contacts, each of whom must download an app. Then, your private keys seed is split using a secret sharing algorithm (based on a well-known cryptography concept called Shamirs Secret Sharing, Chen confirmed to me), with each part sent to your contacts. None of them can retrieve the key on their own, but you can retrieve the key by combining all the parts. Another advantage of this approach is that your key is sort of in the cloud, but its not stored in any central location and certainly not on HTCs servers. HTC will release APIs for third party developers to create apps that work with the Exodus 1 hardware. The phone will also come with pre-installed, blockchain-related apps, but Chen says the specifics of that will be revealed at a later stage. Ive asked Chen about the \"Exodus 1\" moniker, and the companys \"early access\" language, which makes the device sound like an early version of something. \"This is a 1.0 version,\" Chen told me. \"The problem we’re solving is obviously very complicated and there’s a reason no one has managed to do it yet. Namely, giving tools to the people to own their own keys and also when they lose they their phone, the ability to recover it. We need the help of the community to harden our wallet and make it more secure. The crypto internet is still in its infant stages, the Exodus is the first attempt to lay the foundation for that internet. And the first step is to empower and educate the consumer to own their own keys.\" he said. As for the companys original announcement that each Exodus phone will allow users to run a cryptocurrency node, Chen also says this will be added in a \"later stage.\" The HTC Exodus 1 can be pre-ordered at www.htcexodus.com in 34 countries, including the U.S., Taiwan, HK, Singapore, New Zealand, UK, Austria, Norway and \"other European countries.\" It ships in December. In true blockchain style, HTC is pricing the phone in Ethereum and Bitcoin. You will be able to buy it with those two coins, at a price of 0.15 BTC or 4.78 ETH. Thats roughly $960 at the time of writing, but given cryptos volatility, it might be a considerably different number at publish time. Disclosure: The author of this text owns, or has recently owned, a number of cryptocurrencies, including BTC and ETH.\n",

CCN urges readers to conduct their own research with due diligence into the company, product or service mentioned in the press release. Available now on Android and iOS, the free app offers cryptocurrency holders a better user experience, with virtual financial asset banking, transfer, investment, and more. QORMI, MALTA (Oct. 15, 2018) — Noomi Wallet, a brand new, cryptocurrency banking application developed by a dedicated team of blockchain experts, officially launched today for Android and iOS devices. The digital wallet, which aims to make cryptocurrency in everyday life a mainstream reality, is designed to be both practical and easy to use. Serious crypto investors now have a place they can invest their virtual financial assets, or VFAs, in high-yield Bitcoin and Ethereum accounts. And thanks to the streamlined user interface, it’s the perfect app for crypto fans to introduce their family, friends, and associates — i.e. those who may not be as familiar with or comfortable using crypto — to the emerging world of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other VFAs. Among the core features: Invest and grow your VFAs — Open a Bitcoin or Ethereum investment account with fixed, guaranteed APRs. Support for all your VFAs — Noomi already supports some of the world’s most popular cryptocurrencies, which you can store safely in this easy-to-use wallet. These include Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH) and ERC20 tokens, CyberMiles Token (CMT), and more to come. Instant and free transfers and withdrawals — Instantly transfer VFAs to your friends on Noomi for free. W allet staking (coming soon) — Noomi is the first—and only—way for people who don’t have CMT cubes to participate still in block rewards and staking. These features offer immediate value to users and are the first part of an overall vision of building a compelling VFA services solution for the blockchain ecosystem: “Cryptocurrency is giving rise to new ways of interacting with money and commerce,” Andrew Dao, CEO of Noomi said. “There are countless promising new blockchains and tokens being launched that strive to innovate entire industries, unlock new value for users, and create something better and unique. We believe the innovation and creativity of this blockchain-based ecosystem will evolve the way business, commerce, and finance is done, a change that cannot happen overnight.” In addition to its primary VFA banking and payment transfer functions, Noomi sets itself further apart from other crypto wallets on the market by: Empowering users to invest their BTC and ETH like fiat. Noomi works with VFA managers to let users deposit VFAs into investment accounts, with guaranteed returns, great rates (6-10 percent p.a.), and short investment periods (14-30 days). Enabling usernames that you can remember. In addition to a standard wallet address, all Noomi users can choose a unique username for themselves and share that name with other users so that they can send or request cryptocurrency from you instantly. Erasing gas fees. Within the Noomi network, users can send cryptocurrency to each other instantly and for free. When sending outside the Noomi network, Noomi will pay the gas fee* for the supported VFAs. Eliminating the need to have a separate wallet app for different cryptocurrencies. Store and manage all of them in the Noomi Wallet, it’s as simple as that. Furthermore, Noomi’s team is in the process of applying for the Malta government-issued license to store, transfer and manage VFAs, making it one of the first crypto wallets in the world in full compliance with Malta VFA laws and regulations. “Our goal for Noomi is not only to support a new blockchain ecosystem, but also to assist the transition from traditional to blockchain-based practices by providing the critical layers of banking, payment processing, and investment services that tie it all together,” Dao said. “Moreover, we’re doing it in a way that benefits the people and businesses who are pioneers in this change. This app of ours is the first step.” Noomi has partnered with CyberMiles, a new public blockchain for e-commerce, as part of the CyberMiles ecosystem. Noomi is one of more than two dozen “Supernode” candidates for the CyberMiles’ blockchain, which is set for release this week. This strategic move is intended to position Noomi as not only a leader in the VFA services space but also a critical link in the DPoS consensus protocol that will power the CyberMiles network. “Till now, blockchain technology has been geared largely toward technical advancements or improvements like public ledgers and smart contracts,” Dr. Lucas Lu, founder, and CEO of the CyberMiles Foundation said. “While more and more people hear about cryptocurrency every day, few of us actually own it. Its potential to revolutionize how we pay, share information, and even how we interact with each other is yet to be realized. Expanding our ecosystem, we’re confident about paving the way for regular consumers to experience the benefits of cryptocurrency like never before.” Noomi already has undergone a professional security audit to ensure the safety of the VFAs held by the wallet and the users’ personal information. To learn more about the Noomi Wallet, go to noomiwallet.com, or join Noomi’s Telegram community at t.me/noomiofficial. *For a limited time only, Noomi is offering zero gas fees on any ERC20 token transaction from a Noomi user to a non-Noomi user.

      "A 23-year-old woman has been arrested by the Sydney police for stealing $65,000 worth cryptocurrencies from a 56-year-old man. Brisbane Times reported that the woman hacked the victim’s email account in January 2018. She used the two-step verification feature by changing the password and verifying it with her mobile number. She then sent 100,00 XRP to her account in China from the crypto accounts connected to the email account. The XRP were converted into Bitcoins and transferred to multiple e-wallets. The victim was able to acquire his account after two days, however, the woman had drained all his funds by that time. Arthur Katsogiannis, Cybercrime Squad commander, said, “It’s a very significant crime and it’s the first we know of its type in Australia where an individual has been arrested and charged for the technology-enabled theft of cryptocurrency.” Katsogiannis said that even though this crime is the first of its kind, it will become a norm in the coming years. He added that such incidents will prove to be dangerous for investors interested in cryptocurrencies. news.com.au reported that the Public Order and Riot Squad (PORS) caught the woman at her parent’s house in Ebbing and seized all of her electronic devices. The woman is set to appear at Burwood Local Court on November 19. Crypto Crimes Continue to Haunt Authorities Last month, Oklahoma police arrested two men for allegedly stealing $14 million worth CMCT tokens from blockchain-based IT company Crowd Machine. The men got hold of the victim’s SIM card and replaced it with a fake one to use the former to access the crypto wallet. In September 2018, Japanese crypto exchange Zaif lost 6.7 billion yen ($60 million) worth cryptocurrencies stored in hot wallets. This hack bore a resemblance to crypto exchange Coincheck’s hacking incident earlier this year. The exchange lost $530 million worth NEM stored in hot wallets, while the funds stored in cold wallets remained safe. Following the hack, the Financial Services Agency (FSA) of Japan sent business improvement orders to 6 crypto exchanges including Zaif. Japan’s National Police Agency (NPA) recently published a report which explained that 158 crypto crimes were reported in the first half of 2018 alone. The agency added that 60% of these cases occurred due to the use of similar account and password details in various online accounts. With a total of 60 billion yen (approximately $534 million) stolen this year, XRP and BTC are considered the most targeted cryptocurrencies. Featured image from Shutterstock.\n",

      "Over the last 24 hours, the volume of Bitcoin has increased by yet another 10 percent from $3.5 billion to around $3.8 billion. On October 28, the volume of Bitcoin increased by around 20 percent from $3.1 billion to $3.5 billion, showing strong and sustainable momentum in the lower region of $6,000 for the first time since mid-September. Still Low Volume, But What Happened in November? As cryptocurrency investor and technical analyst Hsaka recently stated, the volume of Bitcoin has declined to the October 2017 level. Trading activity in the cryptocurrency exchange market has subsided due to the stagnant price movement of major cryptocurrencies. The decline in momentum of Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, Bitcoin Cash, and EOS have affected the performance of small market cap tokens and digital assets. But, in October, a drop in daily trading volume and a stagnant few months led to a short-term surge in price for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other major cryptocurrencies, allowing the market to achieve a valuation of $800 billion. Since August 9, the price of Bitcoin failed to escape a tight range from $6,300 to $6,600 apart from one occasion in mid-September, and an increase in volatility in the weeks to come could enable the market to achieve positive sentiment prior to the end of 2018. “If you squint hard enough, you can see the $BTC weekly candle. $85 spread between the high and low of the week (as of now). Last time we had lesser volume than this was Oct ’17. Hopefully we see some semblance of volatility into the weekly close,” Hsaka wrote. DonAlt, a cryptocurrency trader, stated that in the days to come, Bitcoin will likely retest $6,200, as it fell below its support level at $6,400. “Finally a movement. And as I guessed right as I’m about to leave for vacation, as always. Looking for a daily close at the edge of the green zone. Intraday a retest of 6200 still very possible.” BCH, XRP, and ETH Down 4% Heavily impacted by the two percent drop in the price of BTC over the past three hours, Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Ripple (XRP), and Ethereum (ETH) declined by more than 4 percent, recording a steep decline for the first time since early October. BCH and EOS recorded a more intense drop in comparison to other major cryptocurrencies, as the two assets often reflect the movement of small cryptocurrencies and tokens during a market downtrend. While the state of the market depends on the speed of the recovery of BTC, analysts generally believe that the crypto market will initiate a fast corrective rally in the days to come, particularly because the sell-off of major assets were triggered without a large spike in volume. The sell-pressure on most digital assets remain less intense than in August and September, which could allow the market to rebound relatively quickly in the short-term.

      "Ripple Labs has unveiled their quarterly market report, and things appear positive overall. Between its two major operations, Ripple Labs and Ripple II, which caters to institutional investors and is fully licensed, the firm moved more than $160 million in ripple (XRP). Interestingly, these sales accounted for less than half a percent of the total volume of the market, meaning that trading in ripple has been on a volatile upswing. The ripple price has risen dramatically over time, currently sitting at over 40 cents a token. With a total market supply of some 100 billion tokens, the network as a whole is currently priced around $40 billion (though just $18.5 billion of those funds are currently in circulation). As with all crypto assets, however, liquidity for a figure of that sort is unlikely. Actual liquid cash convertible from XRP might be in the low hundreds of millions as opposed to billions. Nevertheless, this is a vast improvement over the days when it would have taken 200 XRP to make a dollar. Last year, Ripple locked up 55 billion of its own XRP supply to create stability in the trading markets. The move appears to have played well with the psychology of the cryptocurrency investment community. Over the past three months, 3 billion of that 55 billion have returned to the hands of Ripple, with 2.6 billion being thus returned to escrow. The report explains: “In Q3 2018, 3 billion XRP was again released out of escrow (1 billion each month). 2.6 billion XRP was subsequently put into new escrow contracts. […] The remaining 400 million XRP not returned to escrow is being used in a variety of ways to help support the XRP ecosystem.” An interesting factoid from the report is that for most of the third quarter of this year, Maltese exchanges led the way in terms of trading volume. “Over the last six months, Malta has proposed a number of rules that create a clear legal framework for the trading of digital assets. Additionally, Malta lets international companies pay as little as 5 percent in corporate taxes. Prime Minister Dr. Joseph Muscat has called cryptocurrencies ‘the inevitable future of money.’ This has led to a number of large crypto firms, including Binance and OKEX Technology, moving their operations to the Mediterranean island nation.” Ripple continues to be one of the leading digital currency outfits, and the firm touts regulatory compliance as its modus operandi. The firm has frequently butted heads with traditional cryptocurrency advocates due to its outspoken propensity for government oversight as well as claims that the network itself is centralized. Nevertheless, Ripple appears to be flourishing. Featured Image from Shutterstock. Charts from TradingView.\n",

      "It’s been 10 years since bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto published his white paper on bitcoin, and the global economy hasn’t been the same since. The original cryptocurrency now boasts a market cap of more than $112 billion, while bitcoin’s dominance hovers at more than 53%. But if you ask Nigel Green, founder and CEO of financial advisory firm deVere Group, which boasts $10 billion in AUM, the next 10 years will look a lot different than bitcoin’s first decade. He’s quick to attribute the “crypto revolution” to bitcoin, saying that it has changed the way money is transacted forever. Green’s outlook, however, is a mixed bag, with bitcoin’s “influence and dominance of the cryptocurrency sector” expected to “drastically reduce” while the value of the broader crypto market is poised to expand by 5,000%, which would attach a combined market cap of $20 trillion in the coming decade. Green stated in a press release: “[While] I don’t wish to rain on anyone’s parade, I believe that Bitcoin’s influence and dominance of the cryptocurrency sector will drastically reduce in its second decade. This is because as mass adoption of cryptocurrency grows, more and more digital assets will be launched – by organizations in both the private and the public sectors. This will increase competition for Bitcoin and dent its market share.” Ripple (XRP) and ETH to Steal Bitcoin’s Shine Green, whose firm is based in Dubai but has offices around the world, pointed to other reasons for the forecast, such as better technology, features, and solutions to problems that competing cryptocurrencies will provide, coins like ripple (XRP) and ethereum. He told CCN: “I believe that…XRP will be one of the main digital assets to dent Bitcoin’s market share over the next few years due to its apparent focus on integrating with banks and other financial institutions.” XRP already muscled ETH out of the No. 2 spot for cryptocurrencies on CoinMarketCap more than once this year, though it has since fallen back to the No. 3 spot. Meanwhile, despite the fact that ETH has fallen out of favor with the crypto community of late, Green remains bullish on the future though he falls short of calling for a “flippening” event. “Another one would be its current main challenger Ethereum. This is because a growing number of platforms are adopting Ethereum as a means of trading; there’s an increasing use of smart contracts by Ethereum; and due to the decentralization of cloud computing.” Even if bitcoin’s dominance fades, Green says there is a clear shift among retail and institutional investors away from fiat money and into crypto, one whose momentum will only intensify in the coming decade. As a result, he expects “the market will have grown beyond recognition when Bitcoin celebrates its 20th anniversary.” Featured Image from Shutterstock\n",

      "Throughout the past 24 hours, Bitcoin price seemed to be demonstrating momentum above the $6,400 mark, showing signs of a potential breakout. However, an abrupt fall from $6,430 to $6,370 put an end to the breakout, as BTC failed to breach a minor resistance level. With the volume of BTC at around $3.4 billion on CoinMarketCap, the chance of a major breakout in the next 24 to 48 hours remains relatively low. Stability of Bitcoin: Same Range Over and Over Again On October 15, heavily affected by speculation around Tether (USDT) triggered by the issues between Tether LLC and its US dollar bank, the price of the BTC-to-USDT pair rose to around $7,700 on Bitfinex. As a consequence, the Bitcoin price on fiat-to-cryptocurrency exchanges such as Coinbase, Bitstamp, and Kraken also surged substantially to around $6,800. Since then, the price of BTC has fallen to the range of $6,350 to $6,450, stuck in the same range for more than 10 days since October 16. The sudden increase in the price of BTC on October 15 from $6,120 to $6,800 served as an important short-term catalyst to drive the recovery of Bitcoin. Influenced by the price movement of BTC in mid-October, throughout the past week, BTC has been able to defend the $6,300 support level well despite its insufficient volume and low trading activity in the cryptocurrency exchange market. Cryptocurrency trader and technical analyst Hsaka emphasized that in a period like this, taking leveraged trades and high-risk options is of extreme risk and presents relatively low returns. “Still range-bound. Not taking any leveraged positions here. Weekly open (white) is acting as support now. Both sides of the range have been tapped often enough now to serve as good levels playable on a break and retest.” The stability in the price of Bitcoin and the sideways market of crypto have negative affected the short-term price trend of small market cap tokens, which usually benefit from the stability of the dominant cryptocurrency. Decred, Power Ledger, Loom, Qtum, and Aeternity recorded losses in the range of 5 to 10 percent as the worst performing cryptocurrencies in the global market on October 25. The volume of Bitcoin is low but the daily trading volume of tokens and small market cap cryptocurrencies are continuing to record yearly lows. Tokens could initiate a strong recovery as they have done throughout 2018 if BTC recovers with solid volume. In the weeks to come, analysts do not expect investors to engage in high-risk trades. Ripple and Bitcoin Cash Struggling In recent months, Ripple (XRP), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), EOS, and Stellar (XLM) have demonstrated a price trend which reflects that of tokens and small market cryptocurrencies. The four major cryptotucrrencies recorded losses in the range of 1 to 3 percent against the US dollar. In the upcoming days, it is likely for the crypto market to see stability in the price of BTC and a gradual increase in its volume until BTC tests a major resistance level in the higher region of $6,000.

      "Data from the Bank of Canada and the Ontario Securities Commission has revealed that bitcoin adoption and general crypto awareness in Canada is growing steadily, with the percentage of Canadian poll respondents who own bitcoin rising from 2.9 percent in 2016 to 5 percent in 2017. According to a recently released report by the Bank of Canada titled “Bitcoin Awareness and Usage in Canada: An Update,” Canadians between the ages of 45 and 54 were the group that reported the largest growth in bitcoin ownership over the period, multiplying nearly four times from 0.9 percent in 2016 to 3.5 percent in 2017. Similarly, an OSC report shows that about 1 in 10 Ontarians either currently hold or used to hold cryptoassets. Data Breakdown The Bank of Canada report shows that the gender gap for bitcoin ownership widened considerably over the period in question, with female bitcoin owners in Canada remaining at 2 percent of the population, while the male bitcoin ownership figure nearly doubled, jumping from 4.2 percent to 8.1 percent. Significantly, ownership did not only grow in heavily populated provinces with urban centres like Ontario and British Columbia but grew across all provinces including Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and Alberta. It also showed that the number of holders of small bitcoin amounts has increased by a wider margin than that of people holding more than 10 BTC. The OSC’s data estimates the total number of Ontario residents holding cryptoassets at 500,000 by extrapolating the sample respondents to the population of the entire province. Of these, 63 percent say they own bitcoin, followed by 35 percent for ether, 18 percent for litecoin, 17 percent for bitcoin cash, and 13 percent for ripple (XRP). Very significantly, the report was able to ascertain from respondents when they first purchased their crypto holdings, which revealed that, unsurprisingly, a large percentage purchased their first coins in late 2017 or early 2018. According to the survey, which was conducted in March 2018, 35 percent of crypto holders reported having made their first purchase of cryptocurrency within the previous three months, and a further 37 percent say they first obtained crypto within the past year. Just 27 percent indicated having purchased their crypto more than a year ago, which means that 72 percent of crypto holders in Ontario have bought in over the past one year. This tells a significant story about the growth of crypto adoption in Canada’s most populated province. As cryptocurrencies continue to grow in popularity and spread across Canada, regulators are also keeping an eye on the new opportunities and threats presented in the country, which was recently described as “more blockchain-friendly than the US.” CCN reported in May that Canadian and American regulators are collaborating on a joint cross-border operation targeting ICO and cryptocurrency scams called “Operation Cryptosweep.” Featured Image from Shutterstock\n",

      "Over the past 24 hours, the crypto market has added $2 billion to its valuation, rising to $210 billion. The Bitcoin price has experienced a slight increase in price from $6,370 to $6,430, supported by a minor rise in daily trading volume. Still, the volume of the cryptocurrency exchange market remains weak, with the daily trading volume of Bitcoin remaining below $3.5 billion on Coinmarketcap and $2.42 billion on CoinCap. XRP, the native currency of the Ripple blockchain protocol, has surged by around 3 percent on October 24, possibly due to the approval of Coinbase Custody by the New York Department of Financial Services to operate as a regulated custodian facilitating investments in Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Ripple, and Litecoin. “Coinbase Custody Trust Company will operate as a standalone, independently-capitalized business to Coinbase Inc. and will be held to the same compliance, security and capital requirements as traditional fiduciary custodial businesses like the DTC,” Coinbase Custody product lead Sam McIngvale said. Same Trend For Months Since August, the price trend of Bitcoin has remained in the range of $6,300 to $6,800, failing to break out of the $6,800 resistance level apart from one occasion in mid-September. As such, technical analyst DonAlt stated that in a period of stability, rather than initiating high risk trades, it is safer to observe the market and the short-term price trend of Bitcoin. “Updating the daily chart doesn’t really make much sense, it’s been the same thing for days now. That’s why you get the 4H chart with the zones I’m watching. Before any of these anything but longing S and shorting R makes little sense.” Most traders in the cryptocurrency community echoed a similar sentiment, emphasizing that until the dominant cryptocurrency engages in a major price movement on the downside and the upside, it will be difficult for traders to predict the trend of the market. “Look for longs in the lower 1/3 of the range and shorts in the upper 1/3 of the range. Rinse and repeat until it doesn’t work any more. It really can be that easy,” cryptocurrency trader Mayne said. In previous weeks, when the price of Bitcoin made a move near the $6,700 to $6,800 range, the volume of the asset increased to around $4 billion, which it held relatively well throughout August and September. Yet, over the past two weeks, BTC has struggled to see an increase in its volume, remaining below the $3.5 billion mark. Where the Market Goes Next Investors expect the prices of major cryptocurrencies to increase in the months to come, particularly in December, as interest towards the Bakkt BTC futures market rise prior to its launch. In terms of market development and infrastructure strengthening, the cryptocurrency market is in an ideal position to initiate a short-term rally, supported by the months of stability demonstrated by BTC. Still, due to the lack of momentum and trading activity in the market, the trend of major digital assets remains uncertain. Featured Image from Shutterstock. Charts from TradingView.\n",

      "The value of bitcoin hit an all-time high of nearly $20,000 in December 2017. Less than a year later, however, its value has dropped to about $6,400, according to digital-currency website CoinDesk, whose Bitcoin Price Index tracks prices from several key exchanges. Still, even though bitcoin is worth a lot less today than it was at its peak, if you invested $1,000 five years ago, you would have made a profit. While the value of one bitcoin hit highs of around $1,000 and lows below $600 during December 2013, when the cryptocurrency began to go mainstream, it hovered around $1,000 early in the month. A bitcoin purchased at $1,000 would be worth about $6,400 Thursday, or over six times as much, and your total gain would be over $5,000. This estimate does not include any additional fees or transaction costs. If you bought bitcoin at its high near $20,000, $15,000, or even at $10,000, though, you would have lost money: around $13,600, $8,600 or $3,600, respectively. CoinDesk: Bitcoin Price Index from Oct. 25, 2013, to Oct. 25, 2018 Volatility is pretty common for cryptocurrencies. Ethereum, once valued near $1,300, according to digital-currency tracker coinmarketcap, is now hovering around $200. Digital currencies XRP and Litecoin have seen similar declines. Thats part of the reason seasoned investors say to use caution when approaching crypto. Billionaire entrepreneur Mark Cuban and \"Oracle of Omaha\" Warren Buffett, for example, have both warned that bitcoins value is unstable. Legendary investor and Vanguard founder Jack Bogle, at a Council on Foreign Relations event, told the audience, \"Avoid bitcoin like the plague.\"\n",

      "Over the last 24 hours, the volume of Bitcoin has increased by yet another 10 percent from $3.5 billion to around $3.8 billion. On October 28, the volume of Bitcoin increased by around 20 percent from $3.1 billion to $3.5 billion, showing strong and sustainable momentum in the lower region of $6,000 for the first time since mid-September. Still Low Volume, But What Happened in November? As cryptocurrency investor and technical analyst Hsaka recently stated, the volume of Bitcoin has declined to the October 2017 level. Trading activity in the cryptocurrency exchange market has subsided due to the stagnant price movement of major cryptocurrencies. The decline in momentum of Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, Bitcoin Cash, and EOS have affected the performance of small market cap tokens and digital assets. But, in October, a drop in daily trading volume and a stagnant few months led to a short-term surge in price for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other major cryptocurrencies, allowing the market to achieve a valuation of $800 billion. Since August 9, the price of Bitcoin failed to escape a tight range from $6,300 to $6,600 apart from one occasion in mid-September, and an increase in volatility in the weeks to come could enable the market to achieve positive sentiment prior to the end of 2018. “If you squint hard enough, you can see the $BTC weekly candle. $85 spread between the high and low of the week (as of now). Last time we had lesser volume than this was Oct ’17. Hopefully we see some semblance of volatility into the weekly close,” Hsaka wrote. DonAlt, a cryptocurrency trader, stated that in the days to come, Bitcoin will likely retest $6,200, as it fell below its support level at $6,400. “Finally a movement. And as I guessed right as I’m about to leave for vacation, as always. Looking for a daily close at the edge of the green zone. Intraday a retest of 6200 still very possible.” BCH, XRP, and ETH Down 4% Heavily impacted by the two percent drop in the price of BTC over the past three hours, Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Ripple (XRP), and Ethereum (ETH) declined by more than 4 percent, recording a steep decline for the first time since early October. BCH and EOS recorded a more intense drop in comparison to other major cryptocurrencies, as the two assets often reflect the movement of small cryptocurrencies and tokens during a market downtrend. While the state of the market depends on the speed of the recovery of BTC, analysts generally believe that the crypto market will initiate a fast corrective rally in the days to come, particularly because the sell-off of major assets were triggered without a large spike in volume. The sell-pressure on most digital assets remain less intense than in August and September, which could allow the market to rebound relatively quickly in the short-term.

      "Throughout the past 24 hours, Bitcoin price seemed to be demonstrating momentum above the $6,400 mark, showing signs of a potential breakout. However, an abrupt fall from $6,430 to $6,370 put an end to the breakout, as BTC failed to breach a minor resistance level. With the volume of BTC at around $3.4 billion on CoinMarketCap, the chance of a major breakout in the next 24 to 48 hours remains relatively low. Stability of Bitcoin: Same Range Over and Over Again On October 15, heavily affected by speculation around Tether (USDT) triggered by the issues between Tether LLC and its US dollar bank, the price of the BTC-to-USDT pair rose to around $7,700 on Bitfinex. As a consequence, the Bitcoin price on fiat-to-cryptocurrency exchanges such as Coinbase, Bitstamp, and Kraken also surged substantially to around $6,800. Since then, the price of BTC has fallen to the range of $6,350 to $6,450, stuck in the same range for more than 10 days since October 16. The sudden increase in the price of BTC on October 15 from $6,120 to $6,800 served as an important short-term catalyst to drive the recovery of Bitcoin. Influenced by the price movement of BTC in mid-October, throughout the past week, BTC has been able to defend the $6,300 support level well despite its insufficient volume and low trading activity in the cryptocurrency exchange market. Cryptocurrency trader and technical analyst Hsaka emphasized that in a period like this, taking leveraged trades and high-risk options is of extreme risk and presents relatively low returns. “Still range-bound. Not taking any leveraged positions here. Weekly open (white) is acting as support now. Both sides of the range have been tapped often enough now to serve as good levels playable on a break and retest.” The stability in the price of Bitcoin and the sideways market of crypto have negative affected the short-term price trend of small market cap tokens, which usually benefit from the stability of the dominant cryptocurrency. Decred, Power Ledger, Loom, Qtum, and Aeternity recorded losses in the range of 5 to 10 percent as the worst performing cryptocurrencies in the global market on October 25. The volume of Bitcoin is low but the daily trading volume of tokens and small market cap cryptocurrencies are continuing to record yearly lows. Tokens could initiate a strong recovery as they have done throughout 2018 if BTC recovers with solid volume. In the weeks to come, analysts do not expect investors to engage in high-risk trades. Ripple and Bitcoin Cash Struggling In recent months, Ripple (XRP), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), EOS, and Stellar (XLM) have demonstrated a price trend which reflects that of tokens and small market cryptocurrencies. The four major cryptotucrrencies recorded losses in the range of 1 to 3 percent against the US dollar. In the upcoming days, it is likely for the crypto market to see stability in the price of BTC and a gradual increase in its volume until BTC tests a major resistance level in the higher region of $6,000.

      "Craft brewery BrewDog, known in the UK for operating a chain of drinking pubs for hipsters, has opened a bar in Canary Wharf, London, that accepts not only bitcoin but also changes its markup based on the movement of the Financial Times Stock Exchange 100 Index (FTSE). According to a report on the Drinks Business, the FTSE induced pricing will be exclusively implemented on a “special beer tap.” Due to the location of the bar, which overlooks Bellmouth Passage and the canal linking old North and the South Docks, known for trading, the company says the pricing of the beer will vary based on how the market is doing. If the FTSE goes up, the price of the beer goes on with it. If it falls, you will have an endless supply of beer at a steep discount. Before BrewDog, entrepreneurs Alan Grant and Glenn Burgess created the Reserve Bar Stock Exchange, an automated stock market for booze, three years ago. At the time, Grant had said that “alcohol doesn’t have to be sold at an extortionate rate.” In an official blog post, BrewDog said the new location would also be the first of its bars to accept cryptocurrencies, allowing consumers to pay for their spirits using bitcoin or bitcoin cash and the second cashless bar under the company’s domain. The company advised consumers to come with their credit cards and their Equity Punk ID Card, a form of loyalty card that allows holders to redeem discounts at any of BrewDog’s location. In addition to the grand opening of the Canary Wharf bar, BrewDog will also run a bitcoin cash giveaway, promising to give the first 100 attendees a BCH wallet pre-loaded with crypto between £12 and £100. Earlier this month, Mr. Wolf’s , a nightclub in Bristol had an event where customers were allowed to pay for a pint of beer with bitcoin for the night. Mr. Wolf’s was ecstatic about the one-off event, which was done to support the documentary of two movie producers and prove that bitcoin could be a viable currency in a society that is fast becoming cashless.

      "Over the last 24 hours, the volume of Bitcoin has increased by yet another 10 percent from $3.5 billion to around $3.8 billion. On October 28, the volume of Bitcoin increased by around 20 percent from $3.1 billion to $3.5 billion, showing strong and sustainable momentum in the lower region of $6,000 for the first time since mid-September. Still Low Volume, But What Happened in November? As cryptocurrency investor and technical analyst Hsaka recently stated, the volume of Bitcoin has declined to the October 2017 level. Trading activity in the cryptocurrency exchange market has subsided due to the stagnant price movement of major cryptocurrencies. The decline in momentum of Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, Bitcoin Cash, and EOS have affected the performance of small market cap tokens and digital assets. But, in October, a drop in daily trading volume and a stagnant few months led to a short-term surge in price for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other major cryptocurrencies, allowing the market to achieve a valuation of $800 billion. Since August 9, the price of Bitcoin failed to escape a tight range from $6,300 to $6,600 apart from one occasion in mid-September, and an increase in volatility in the weeks to come could enable the market to achieve positive sentiment prior to the end of 2018. “If you squint hard enough, you can see the $BTC weekly candle. $85 spread between the high and low of the week (as of now). Last time we had lesser volume than this was Oct ’17. Hopefully we see some semblance of volatility into the weekly close,” Hsaka wrote. DonAlt, a cryptocurrency trader, stated that in the days to come, Bitcoin will likely retest $6,200, as it fell below its support level at $6,400. “Finally a movement. And as I guessed right as I’m about to leave for vacation, as always. Looking for a daily close at the edge of the green zone. Intraday a retest of 6200 still very possible.” BCH, XRP, and ETH Down 4% Heavily impacted by the two percent drop in the price of BTC over the past three hours, Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Ripple (XRP), and Ethereum (ETH) declined by more than 4 percent, recording a steep decline for the first time since early October. BCH and EOS recorded a more intense drop in comparison to other major cryptocurrencies, as the two assets often reflect the movement of small cryptocurrencies and tokens during a market downtrend. While the state of the market depends on the speed of the recovery of BTC, analysts generally believe that the crypto market will initiate a fast corrective rally in the days to come, particularly because the sell-off of major assets were triggered without a large spike in volume. The sell-pressure on most digital assets remain less intense than in August and September, which could allow the market to rebound relatively quickly in the short-term.

      "Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange, has voluntarily engaged in an initiative to eliminate money laundering on its platform. For years, despite the inherent lack of privacy measures on major public blockchain networks like Bitcoin and Ethereum that discourage the settlement of illicit transactions, a widely pushed narrative against crypto has been the suspected usage of digital assets by criminals. Eliminating Easily Refutable Claims Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, Bitcoin Cash, EOS, and many other major cryptocurrencies are not anonymous by nature. With Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) systems integrated by cryptocurrency exchanges, it is extremely difficult for criminals to utilize digital assets to settle the transfer of illegal proceeds. Authorities and government agencies across the globe are well aware of the non-anonymous characteristic of blockchains, which could have motivated governments like the US, Japan, and South Korea to legitimate and recognize the cryptocurrency market. This week, Binance has started to cooperate with Chainalysis, a leading blockchain analysis company that evaluates suspicious transactions and addresses, to improve its AML system and to further legitimize the cryptocurrency sector. “Cryptocurrency businesses of all sizes face the same core challenge: earning the trust of regulators, financial institutions and users. We expect many to follow Binance’s lead to build world-class AML compliance programs to satisfy regulators globally and build trust with major financial institutions,” said Jonathan Levin, co-founder and COO of Chainalysis. In 2018, some of the world’s most influential banks were cracked down for money laundering. Danske Bank laundered $243 billion from criminal groups, and as CCN reported on October 20, Nordea Bank, the largest financial group in the Nordic countries, is said to have taken several illicit payments from banks in the Baltic region. With the institutional market of cryptocurrencies growing exponentially, the tightening of AML systems employed by public exchanges is expected to solidify cryptocurrencies as a recognized asset class and the digital asset market as a well-regulated sector. Wei Zhao, the CFO at Binance, said that maintaining the firm’s vision of increasing the freedom of money globally, the exchange will continue to adhere to regulatory mandates in the countries it operates in. “By working with Chainalysis, we are able to continue building a foundational compliance program that enables the next phase of our growth. Our vision is to provide the infrastructure for a blockchain ecosystem and increase the freedom of money globally, while adhering to regulatory mandates in the countries we serve.” Importance of Compliance The cryptocurrency sector is entering a new phase of development and growth, as Zhou explained. During the 2017 bull market in which the valuation of the cryptocurrency market surged to $800 billion, the asset class obtained significant mainstream awareness in both countries that support crypto and regions that have established impractical regulatory frameworks to prevent local blockchain markets to flourish. In a period in which governments are introducing increasing efforts to embrace crypto and blockchain businesses as a part of the fourth industrial revolution, voluntary initiatives by companies like Binance to legitimize the industry will ease the process of governments in regulating and acknowledging the global market.

      "Throughout the past 24 hours, Bitcoin price seemed to be demonstrating momentum above the $6,400 mark, showing signs of a potential breakout. However, an abrupt fall from $6,430 to $6,370 put an end to the breakout, as BTC failed to breach a minor resistance level. With the volume of BTC at around $3.4 billion on CoinMarketCap, the chance of a major breakout in the next 24 to 48 hours remains relatively low. Stability of Bitcoin: Same Range Over and Over Again On October 15, heavily affected by speculation around Tether (USDT) triggered by the issues between Tether LLC and its US dollar bank, the price of the BTC-to-USDT pair rose to around $7,700 on Bitfinex. As a consequence, the Bitcoin price on fiat-to-cryptocurrency exchanges such as Coinbase, Bitstamp, and Kraken also surged substantially to around $6,800. Since then, the price of BTC has fallen to the range of $6,350 to $6,450, stuck in the same range for more than 10 days since October 16. The sudden increase in the price of BTC on October 15 from $6,120 to $6,800 served as an important short-term catalyst to drive the recovery of Bitcoin. Influenced by the price movement of BTC in mid-October, throughout the past week, BTC has been able to defend the $6,300 support level well despite its insufficient volume and low trading activity in the cryptocurrency exchange market. Cryptocurrency trader and technical analyst Hsaka emphasized that in a period like this, taking leveraged trades and high-risk options is of extreme risk and presents relatively low returns. “Still range-bound. Not taking any leveraged positions here. Weekly open (white) is acting as support now. Both sides of the range have been tapped often enough now to serve as good levels playable on a break and retest.” The stability in the price of Bitcoin and the sideways market of crypto have negative affected the short-term price trend of small market cap tokens, which usually benefit from the stability of the dominant cryptocurrency. Decred, Power Ledger, Loom, Qtum, and Aeternity recorded losses in the range of 5 to 10 percent as the worst performing cryptocurrencies in the global market on October 25. The volume of Bitcoin is low but the daily trading volume of tokens and small market cap cryptocurrencies are continuing to record yearly lows. Tokens could initiate a strong recovery as they have done throughout 2018 if BTC recovers with solid volume. In the weeks to come, analysts do not expect investors to engage in high-risk trades. Ripple and Bitcoin Cash Struggling In recent months, Ripple (XRP), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), EOS, and Stellar (XLM) have demonstrated a price trend which reflects that of tokens and small market cryptocurrencies. The four major cryptotucrrencies recorded losses in the range of 1 to 3 percent against the US dollar. In the upcoming days, it is likely for the crypto market to see stability in the price of BTC and a gradual increase in its volume until BTC tests a major resistance level in the higher region of $6,000.

With the volume of BTC at around $3.4 billion on CoinMarketCap, the chance of a major breakout in the next 24 to 48 hours remains relatively low. Stability of Bitcoin: Same Range Over and Over Again On October 15, heavily affected by speculation around Tether (USDT) triggered by the issues between Tether LLC and its US dollar bank, the price of the BTC-to-USDT pair rose to around $7,700 on Bitfinex. As a consequence, the Bitcoin price on fiat-to-cryptocurrency exchanges such as Coinbase, Bitstamp, and Kraken also surged substantially to around $6,800. Since then, the price of BTC has fallen to the range of $6,350 to $6,450, stuck in the same range for more than 10 days since October 16. The sudden increase in the price of BTC on October 15 from $6,120 to $6,800 served as an important short-term catalyst to drive the recovery of Bitcoin. Influenced by the price movement of BTC in mid-October, throughout the past week, BTC has been able to defend the $6,300 support level well despite its insufficient volume and low trading activity in the cryptocurrency exchange market. Cryptocurrency trader and technical analyst Hsaka emphasized that in a period like this, taking leveraged trades and high-risk options is of extreme risk and presents relatively low returns. “Still range-bound. Not taking any leveraged positions here. Weekly open (white) is acting as support now. Both sides of the range have been tapped often enough now to serve as good levels playable on a break and retest.” The stability in the price of Bitcoin and the sideways market of crypto have negative affected the short-term price trend of small market cap tokens, which usually benefit from the stability of the dominant cryptocurrency. Decred, Power Ledger, Loom, Qtum, and Aeternity recorded losses in the range of 5 to 10 percent as the worst performing cryptocurrencies in the global market on October 25. The volume of Bitcoin is low but the daily trading volume of tokens and small market cap cryptocurrencies are continuing to record yearly lows. Tokens could initiate a strong recovery as they have done throughout 2018 if BTC recovers with solid volume. In the weeks to come, analysts do not expect investors to engage in high-risk trades. Ripple and Bitcoin Cash Struggling In recent months, Ripple (XRP), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), EOS, and Stellar (XLM) have demonstrated a price trend which reflects that of tokens and small market cryptocurrencies. The four major cryptotucrrencies recorded losses in the range of 1 to 3 percent against the US dollar. In the upcoming days, it is likely for the crypto market to see stability in the price of BTC and a gradual increase in its volume until BTC tests a major resistance level in the higher region of $6,000.

      "TrueUSD (TUSD), Circle Coin (USDC), Gemini Dollar (GUSD), and Paxos (PAX), new generation stablecoins competing against Tether (USDT), are all based on the Ethereum blockchain network. Crucially, all of the three above mentioned stablecoins are fully audited, transparent, and regulated, which allow them to obtain stable banking services and guarantee the ability of consumers to redeem the tokens based on a 1:1 ration with the US dollar. Ethereum-Based Tokens Deploying a stablecoin on top of the Ethereum blockchain protocol instantaneously improves the compatibility of the asset with existing infrastructure. For instance, users of GUSD, PAX, and TUSD can utilize hardware wallets like Trezor and Ledger along with software wallets such as Metamask to send and receive stablecoins. “Improved send and receive. Two Ethereum wallets can quickly send and receive any amount of USDC at any time of day. Large transfers for business purposes become as easy as small e-commerce payments. Consumers can use the Coinbase app to send USDC to someone, while remaining confident the value is stable,” the Coinbase team explained, which recently integrated USDC with Circle. It also allows exchanges to easily integrate stablecoins without the necessity of creating a new infrastructure to support stablecoins. The Coinbase team emphasized that the usage of the Ethereum blockchain network enables developers to program the dollar, which allows fintech companies to develop programs that can easily and securely facilitate stablecoin transactions. “A programmable dollar. For developers and fintech companies, a digital dollar like USDC is easier to program with. For example, given the private keys for USDC, a program can easily send and receive them back and forth using the public Ethereum blockchain.” Most importantly, with stablecoins launched on Ethereum, users can track the circulation of the tokens with block explorers like Etherscan. Because the tokens are stored in smart contracts, users can track the amount of US dollars stored in a particular stablecoin, increasing the overall transparency of the currency. Subsequent to its launch, the Gemini team heavily emphasized the fact that GUSD is built on the Ethereum network with compliance with the ERC20 token contract standard, due to the various benefits the compatibility with Ethereum can provide. “To date, there has been no trusted and regulated digital representation of the U.S. dollar that moves in an open, decentralized manner like cryptocurrencies. Enter the Gemini dollar — a stable value coin (often called a “stablecoin”) that is (i) issued by Gemini, a New York trust company, (ii) strictly pegged 1:1 to the U.S. dollar, and (iii) built on the Ethereum network according to the ERC20 standard for tokens.” Cryptocurrency is in a Growth Curve The cryptocurrency market and industry are in a growth curve. In the years to come, as infrastructure surrounding the cryptocurrency market strengthens, opaque, inefficient, and unregulated platforms, assets, and projects will be replaced with more practical, transparent, and regulated alternatives. The stablecoin market has seen the emergence of new competitors against Tether that are transparent, regulated, and compliant with the existing infrastructure in the market.

      "Mount Kenya provides visitors with a picturesque appeal reminiscent of the ambiance in a world of utopia. Beyond the charm and aura lies a tech-savvy Kenyan restaurant that has incorporated cryptocurrencies for facilitating payment. Betty’s place puts its culinary skills into effective use in “nyama choma,” a tantalizing goat meat barbeque that many Kenyans savor. Situated in the rural town of Nyeri, roughly 150km (90 miles) from the sprawling federal capital, Nairobi, it is one of the few startups in the country that has embraced blockchain technologies by allowing customers make payment with two cryptocurrencies – Bitcoin and Dash. The Proprietress of the restaurant enthused on her ability to latch onto the big picture. “Since the world is becoming more global, my place is also becoming a global restaurant,” she said. The dividends of her ingenuity include the traffic of visitors who stop by at her restaurant from different parts of the world. “I attract different customers from different parts of the world, whichever coin they have. As long as it’s a viable coin, we accept it.” Ms. Wambugu ventured into trading in Bitcoin some years back, and within the space of 24 months, her working capital became large enough to purchase the two-story Nyeri hotel which she renamed Betty’s Place. Strategically located along Nyeri’s major road axis, Betty’s Place has a commanding aesthetic appeal with its bright mustard-colored walls and magnificent windows. The design itself is a luring invitation to the libido that wells in the stomach. Hungry patrons fall to the bait of such irresistible aroma of meat on the grill. When you add the melodious symphony of the Kenyan orchestra, you can imagine why many have found the place as a resort. Bitcoin Tutorials Betty’s Place is not just a place where you enjoy the unique culinary cuisine of Kenyans, and it is also becoming a citadel for learning the rudiments of Bitcoin. Ms. Wambugu prides herself as a crypto-currency pioneer, and it will be out of place if she is faulted since she is putting her nous into effective use. She introduced tutorial sessions on bitcoin for interested individuals, and the classes hold every Sunday at her restaurant. “I’ve set aside one day where I can teach my customers. Whoever asks about cryptocurrencies: How does it work? What is Bitcoin? I train them.” she said. Blockchain Technology Used In Housing Scheme Cryptocurrency adoption in Kenya keeps rising despite a recurrent warning by the country’s apex bank, advising its citizens on the dangers of dealing with digital assets. While the country’s central bank has warned citizens against cryptocurrencies, the State’s Housing and Urban Development has rolled out plans to incorporate blockchain technology for the distribution of Government housing units. The latest innovation is aimed at developing a scheme that will efficiently allocate houses using sophisticated ledger for proper management. Featured image from Shutterstock.\n",

      "Mastercard has gone all the way through the stages of the resistance proverb — “first they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win.” Cryptocurrencies & Mastercard: A Turbulent History Like most financial companies, Mastercard never expected the blockchain, and by the time they took note of it, they were unprepared for the changes it could and will bring. So their earliest reactions were, to say the least, not positive. A massive firm, however, they were at the same time studying the technology and looking for ways to utilize it, as well as looking for ways to legally make use of cryptocurrencies. The company has been all over the place on the issue, eventually admitting that it could be “good.” The Ultimate Irony: Fractional Reserve Blockchain Now, some years after initially associating cryptocurrencies with crime, Mastercard is seeking a patent for fractional reserve management of blockchain assets. You read that right, and there are likely a number of cryptonaughts laughing their heads off as they digest this. Fractional reserve banking is one of the problems Bitcoin was designed to solve. It is a practice which most who gravitate toward cryptocurrencies would prefer to see eradicated. In general, Bitcoiners are not fans of debt-based currency. Bitcoin and most other cryptocurrencies are therefore regarded as sound money. A Step Beyond Not Owning Your Keys: Not Even Being Sure the Institution Has Your Funds The patent Mastercard is seeking — application 20180308092 — describes a system which will simultaneously track crypto assets and fiat assets. Essentially, it’s a web wallet with a combination of cryptocurrency and fiat accounts. Bitcoin banking institutions like Coinbase have had trouble gaining traction with cryptocurrency natives over the years for the simple reason that the user/owner of the funds does not then hold the keys. In the cryptonaught’s eyes, not holding the keys to your coin is the same as not holding your coin at all. It can disappear, and there is nothing you can do about it. Thus, the largest component of Coinbase’s customers has been newcomers looking for convenient ways to acquire Bitcoin. The patent essentially describes a cryptocurrency credit card network. “Thus, there is a need to improve on the storage and processing of transactions that utilize blockchain currencies. Existing payment networks and payment processing systems that utilize fiat currency are specially designed and configured to safely store and protect consumer and merchant information and credentials and to transmit sensitive data between computing systems. In addition, existing payment systems are often configured to perform complex calculations, risk assessments, and fraud algorithm applications extremely fast, as to ensure quick processing of fiat currency transactions. Accordingly, the use of traditional payment networks and payment systems technologies in combination with blockchain currencies may provide consumers and merchants the benefits of the decentralized blockchain while still maintaining security of account information and provide a strong defense against fraud and theft.” They see a benefit to mixing traditional and cryptocurrency technologies, and the system described would likely include their existing products and payment networks. “Transactions that may be performed via a payment network may include product or service purchases, credit purchases, debit transactions, fund transfers, account withdrawals, etc. Payment networks may be configured to perform transactions via cash-substitutes, which may include payment cards, letters of credit, checks, transaction accounts, etc.” Mastercard seeks to do what it does best: process transactions. In the same way, funds can be moved around an exchange or a gambling site instantaneously once their deposits are cleared, Mastercard would like to make this possible for merchants. In this respect, despite the problems associated with fractional reserve anything, Mastercard could potentially make a massive contribution to the Bitcoin economy by enabling millions of existing clients to accept cryptocurrency payments. Patents take time to process, so we will see how this develops. Images from Shutterstock\n",

      "Taiwanese consumer electronics giant HTC has officially launched its first blockchain phone, which will be sold exclusively in crypto. Called Exodus 1, the blockchain mobile phone of HTC is available to consumers at a fixed price of 0.15 Bitcoin (ETC) and 4.78 Ethereum (ETH), nearing the price of the new iPhone XS that has a starting price of $999. The Exodus 1 is sold at around $975 based on the current price of Bitcoin at $6,500. However, as the price of BTC rises, the price of the phone will also increase substantially. BTC was valued at $10,000 less than four months ago, and if BTC reaches the $10,000 resistance level in the months to come, the value of the Exodus 1 could surge to $1,500. Why Pegged to BTC and ETH? The primary feature of the Exodus 1 is its security. It has been developed to operate as a hardware cryptocurrency wallet, allowing users to safely store digital assets in the local wallet of the phone. In July, Samsung, the largest electronics manufacturer in Asia, revealed that mobile phones are significantly more secure in processing cryptocurrency payments than alternative devices and platforms such as desktop and the web because of the existence of a trusted ecosystem called the Trusted Execution Environment (TEE). With TEE in place, which operates as a separate execution environment with its own memory and storage, it is not possible for hackers to breach into protected information stored within the TEE ecosystem in the event of a hacking attack or a security breach. “This is why smartphones have an edge over laptops and desktops for cryptocurrency wallets: without the benefits of the hardware-based TEE, the keys are more vulnerable. There is a significant caveat: a naïve wallet developer might choose to simply store the keys on the normal internal storage of the phone, in which case there’s little additional protection from using the smartphone platform,” Joel Snyder, a senior IT consultant at Samsung Insights, explained. Exodus 1 of HTC leverages this ecosystem along with several other security features in a mobile phone to create a secure environment for cryptocurrency users. In regards to the decision of the company to sell the device exclusively in crypto with price pegged to BTC and ETH, Phil Chen, head of HTC’s blockchain initiative, told Hong Kong-based mainstream publication SCMP said that the company only intends to sell the device to the core audience that is the global blockchain community. “Selling it in crypto only and being the first to do so means we are bringing this directly to the core audience and those who will want this device – the blockchain community. It reflects our belief in cryptocurrencies – in fact we had to recreate and overcome many processes internally, as well as find new distributors, so that we can achieve the goal of only accepting cryptocurrencies as the form of payment.” Price Change In the months to come, if the price of BTC and ETH rise or decline by a large margin, HTC is expected to adjust the price of its mobile phone to maintain a realistic price tag which its consumer base can afford.

      "The UK government has blocked a Royal Mint plan to create a “digital gold” token that would trade on a cryptocurrency exchange. According to sources cited in Reuters, the British finance ministry refused to approve the 1,100-year old Mint’s plans to issue as much as $1 billion worth of “Royal Mint Gold” (RMG) tokens, which would have been backed by gold assets stored in the government-owned Mint’s vaults. “Sadly, due to market conditions this did not prove possible at this time, but we will revisit this if and when market conditions are right,” a Mint spokesperson was cited as saying. Initially, The Royal Mint had planned to list the tokens on a blockchain-based exchange operated by U.S. derivatives exchange CME, which also manages the largest regulated bitcoin futures market. However, the CME backed out of the partnership just prior to the scheduled launch date late last year, delaying the project and forcing the Mint to pursue a cryptocurrency exchange listing to save the venture. That was a bridge too far for the finance ministry, who considered such a partnership too risky for the Mint, and, by extension, the government. Without approval to move forward with the project, Mint CEO Anne Jessop — who was appointed in Feb. 2018 — shut the project down, leading to four employees being laid off and another 7-8 “made redundant.” Had the full $1 billion in RMG been issued on a public blockchain, the token would have been numbered among the world’s most valuable cryptocurrencies. At current valuations, it would have ranked just outside the top 15 largest cryptoassets, trailing closely behind NEO and ethereum classic (ETC). The sources cited in the report suggested that CME, which launched bitcoin futures in Dec. 2017 and has seen minor-but-growing volumes in this market, may be “cooling” toward this nascent asset class. “CME’s management changed, and they walked away, didn’t want to get involved,” one source told the publication. CME, on its part, told Reuters that it was “continuing to assess client demand with our partner and have nothing new to report at this time.” CCN had first reported the Royal Mint’s plans to create a blockchain asset back in 2016.

      "(This story corrects paragraph four to show non-profit group helps all refugees, not only Jewish refugees) A woman places flowers on an impromptu memorial at the Tree of Life synagogue where 11 worshippers were murdered during Saturdays shooting at the synagogue in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, U.S., October 28, 2018. REUTERS/Cathal McNaughton By Trevor Hunnicutt and Paresh Dave (Reuters) - Gab.com, the website where the suspected Pittsburgh synagogue gunman posted anti-Semitic views, said on Sunday it was offline for a period of time after being asked by its domain provider to move to another registrar. The move comes after GoDaddy Inc (GDDY.N) asked Gab to change the domain, while PayPal Holdings Inc (PYPL.O), Stripe Inc and Joynet Inc blocked the website. “We have informed Gab.com that they have 24 hours to move the domain to another registrar,” a spokesman for GoDaddy said, adding the site violated its terms of service and hosted content that “promotes and encourages violence against people.” The 46-year-old suspect Robert Bowers in the shooting incident has been charged with murdering 11 people on Saturday in the deadliest attack ever on the Jewish community in the United States. Hours earlier, he posted on Gab.com, saying a non-profit that helps refugees relocate to the country was helping to kill “my people.” “Gab.com is under attack. We have been systematically no-platformed by App Stores, multiple hosting providers, and several payment processors,” the website said, adding that it was working around the clock to get Gab.com back online. PayPal banned the website from using its money-sending services on Saturday. Gab said on Saturday it received notice it would be blocked by another payments website, Stripe Inc, and had switched to a new web-hosting service after Joyent Inc warned it would cut off the website. Gab did not say who the new web host was. The company posted on Twitter on Sunday, “FREE SPEECH WILL ALWAYS WIN.” Founded in 2016 by conservative Andrew Torba, Gab bills itself as the “free speech” alternative to Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) and Facebook Inc (FB.O) and has become a popular place to post content unwelcome or prohibited on other platforms. Bowers, 46, joined the site in January. Notable users include right-wing provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos and Andrew Anglin, the founder of the neo-Nazi Daily Stormer website, as well as media personalities Alex Jones and Carl Benjamin. The free website charges for access to additional features and also raises money on the crowdfunding website StartEngine. Torba did not respond to a request for comment on Sunday. Utsav Sanduja, Gab’s former chief operating officer, said the company and its mission will survive “guilt by association” and could do more fundraising through cryptocurrencies in order to bypass tech companies. “We created Gab for the purpose of letting off steam not to kill. That was not our intention,” he said. In earlier statements, the website said it was cooperating with law enforcement authorities and described the moves by PayPal and others as acts of “direct collusion between big tech giants.” It also called on U.S. President Donald Trump to act. PayPal declined to comment beyond an earlier statement that the company takes immediate action when “a site is allowing the perpetuation of hate, violence or discriminatory intolerance.” Joyent could not immediately be reached, and Stripe declined to comment on individual users. Sanduja did say that there could be room for Gab to improve. “The mission should not change, but certainly there does need to be better checks and balances in place,” he said. Sanduja said he left his role at the website in June after Gab users threatened his life and that of his wife, who works at a synagogue. On Sunday, Gab’s forum lit up with comments about the Pittsburgh attack. One user celebrated Gab being banned by PayPal while another user responded, “You are going to get shot at ur local synagogue.” Another posted, “I WAS RIGHT, THEY FAKED THE SYNAGOGUE SHOOTING.” Gab raised $1 million through crowdfunding last year, but recorded a loss of $201,704, according to a document filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) said in an emailed statement that it terminated Gab’s accounts on its Azure cloud computing platform last month. Alphabet Inc’s (GOOGL.O) Google and Apple Inc’s (AAPL.O) mobile app stores previously blocked Gab, cutting off a crucial source of access to new users. Facebook’s archive of ads that it considers political in nature shows Gab has run only one such ad since May. It paid less than $100 for that ad and generated 1,000 to 5,000 views last month, according to the archive. The company had no active ad campaigns on Facebook or Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) as of Saturday, according to those companies’ ad transparency databases. Gab’s account on Twitter warned users on Saturday to expect that they would be banned from that website and Facebook soon. A Facebook spokeswoman said the company is reviewing Gab’s presence on its website. Twitter declined to comment.\n",

      "(This story corrects paragraph four to show non-profit group helps all refugees, not only Jewish refugees) A woman places flowers on an impromptu memorial at the Tree of Life synagogue where 11 worshippers were murdered during Saturdays shooting at the synagogue in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, U.S., October 28, 2018. REUTERS/Cathal McNaughton By Trevor Hunnicutt and Paresh Dave (Reuters) - Gab.com, the website where the suspected Pittsburgh synagogue gunman posted anti-Semitic views, said on Sunday it was offline for a period of time after being asked by its domain provider to move to another registrar. The move comes after GoDaddy Inc (GDDY.N) asked Gab to change the domain, while PayPal Holdings Inc (PYPL.O), Stripe Inc and Joynet Inc blocked the website. “We have informed Gab.com that they have 24 hours to move the domain to another registrar,” a spokesman for GoDaddy said, adding the site violated its terms of service and hosted content that “promotes and encourages violence against people.” The 46-year-old suspect Robert Bowers in the shooting incident has been charged with murdering 11 people on Saturday in the deadliest attack ever on the Jewish community in the United States. Hours earlier, he posted on Gab.com, saying a non-profit that helps refugees relocate to the country was helping to kill “my people.” “Gab.com is under attack. We have been systematically no-platformed by App Stores, multiple hosting providers, and several payment processors,” the website said, adding that it was working around the clock to get Gab.com back online. PayPal banned the website from using its money-sending services on Saturday. Gab said on Saturday it received notice it would be blocked by another payments website, Stripe Inc, and had switched to a new web-hosting service after Joyent Inc warned it would cut off the website. Gab did not say who the new web host was. The company posted on Twitter on Sunday, “FREE SPEECH WILL ALWAYS WIN.” Founded in 2016 by conservative Andrew Torba, Gab bills itself as the “free speech” alternative to Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) and Facebook Inc (FB.O) and has become a popular place to post content unwelcome or prohibited on other platforms. Bowers, 46, joined the site in January. Notable users include right-wing provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos and Andrew Anglin, the founder of the neo-Nazi Daily Stormer website, as well as media personalities Alex Jones and Carl Benjamin. The free website charges for access to additional features and also raises money on the crowdfunding website StartEngine. Torba did not respond to a request for comment on Sunday. Utsav Sanduja, Gab’s former chief operating officer, said the company and its mission will survive “guilt by association” and could do more fundraising through cryptocurrencies in order to bypass tech companies. “We created Gab for the purpose of letting off steam not to kill. That was not our intention,” he said. In earlier statements, the website said it was cooperating with law enforcement authorities and described the moves by PayPal and others as acts of “direct collusion between big tech giants.” It also called on U.S. President Donald Trump to act. PayPal declined to comment beyond an earlier statement that the company takes immediate action when “a site is allowing the perpetuation of hate, violence or discriminatory intolerance.” Joyent could not immediately be reached, and Stripe declined to comment on individual users. Sanduja did say that there could be room for Gab to improve. “The mission should not change, but certainly there does need to be better checks and balances in place,” he said. Sanduja said he left his role at the website in June after Gab users threatened his life and that of his wife, who works at a synagogue. On Sunday, Gab’s forum lit up with comments about the Pittsburgh attack. One user celebrated Gab being banned by PayPal while another user responded, “You are going to get shot at ur local synagogue.” Another posted, “I WAS RIGHT, THEY FAKED THE SYNAGOGUE SHOOTING.” Gab raised $1 million through crowdfunding last year, but recorded a loss of $201,704, according to a document filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) said in an emailed statement that it terminated Gab’s accounts on its Azure cloud computing platform last month. Alphabet Inc’s (GOOGL.O) Google and Apple Inc’s (AAPL.O) mobile app stores previously blocked Gab, cutting off a crucial source of access to new users. Facebook’s archive of ads that it considers political in nature shows Gab has run only one such ad since May. It paid less than $100 for that ad and generated 1,000 to 5,000 views last month, according to the archive. The company had no active ad campaigns on Facebook or Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) as of Saturday, according to those companies’ ad transparency databases. Gab’s account on Twitter warned users on Saturday to expect that they would be banned from that website and Facebook soon. A Facebook spokeswoman said the company is reviewing Gab’s presence on its website. Twitter declined to comment.\n",

      "Privacy-focused Zcash, currently worth just over $110 per coin, has completed a network upgrade dubbed “Sapling” that it says will vastly improve transaction speed as well as reduce the actual size of transactions themselves. Zcash hopes that this will make mobile and other types of transactions more common and feasible on the network, saying it “introduces significant efficiency improvements for shielded transactions that will pave the way for broad mobile, exchange and vendor adoption of Zcash shielded addresses.” Zcash has two types of addresses. A standard “t”-type (transparent) address works in the same way as most cryptocurrencies: sender and receiver information are publicly available on the network at time of transaction. Shielded addresses work much more like Monero and other privacy-centric currencies in that it is almost impossible to be privy to transaction information aside from sums transacted without the sender or receiver revealing such information. The Sapling upgrade primarily improves the efficiency of private transactions. Shielded Transactions Now Up to 100 Times Lighter, 6 Times Faster The memory requirement for z-type transactions under the Sapling upgrade has been reduced to 40 megabytes and the hardware being used to authorize/create a transaction does not have to be the hardware that creates the “proof.” Both of these updates are important in the implementation of a mobile payment network built on Zcash. An added bonus of the upgrade is that transaction information can be accessed without exposing a private key – again, important for mobile transactions in that many users might not want to carry such important information on them at all times. The upgrade is mostly important to developers of mobile applications and exchange software who will see it as a way to offer Zcash products in a much more efficient manner. Sapling has been anticipated for months, as noted in our report on the previous Overwinter upgrade, but in an immediate sense it does not seem to have led to increased demand for ZEC. While volume is high, the price appears to be struggling – which should not be a surprise to anyone monitoring cryptocurrencies in 2018, as most of them seem to be having similar problems. All Major Exchanges Supporting Upgrade Essentially every exchange listing ZEC has supported the upgrade, meaning that private withdrawals will become much more feasible. While the technology behind Zcash still has some distance to go in order to successfully transact privately with the same efficiency as public blockchain tokens, the upgrade is a major step in that direction, and the reduced resource requirements will likely lead to increased adoption of the crypto. Spokesmen and developers of Zcash still maintain that continued upgrades of its protocol will eventually lead to “privacy-by-default” in cryptocurrency transactions, major platforms like Bitcoin have yet to make any notable moves in the same direction. Thus while the efforts of Zcash can be lauded and the existence of privacy-centric options is especially important in regions where there are dangers associated with monetary transactions, the dream of “privacy-by-default” has yet to be fully realized.

      "Throughout the past 24 hours, Bitcoin price seemed to be demonstrating momentum above the $6,400 mark, showing signs of a potential breakout. However, an abrupt fall from $6,430 to $6,370 put an end to the breakout, as BTC failed to breach a minor resistance level. With the volume of BTC at around $3.4 billion on CoinMarketCap, the chance of a major breakout in the next 24 to 48 hours remains relatively low. Stability of Bitcoin: Same Range Over and Over Again On October 15, heavily affected by speculation around Tether (USDT) triggered by the issues between Tether LLC and its US dollar bank, the price of the BTC-to-USDT pair rose to around $7,700 on Bitfinex. As a consequence, the Bitcoin price on fiat-to-cryptocurrency exchanges such as Coinbase, Bitstamp, and Kraken also surged substantially to around $6,800. Since then, the price of BTC has fallen to the range of $6,350 to $6,450, stuck in the same range for more than 10 days since October 16. The sudden increase in the price of BTC on October 15 from $6,120 to $6,800 served as an important short-term catalyst to drive the recovery of Bitcoin. Influenced by the price movement of BTC in mid-October, throughout the past week, BTC has been able to defend the $6,300 support level well despite its insufficient volume and low trading activity in the cryptocurrency exchange market. Cryptocurrency trader and technical analyst Hsaka emphasized that in a period like this, taking leveraged trades and high-risk options is of extreme risk and presents relatively low returns. “Still range-bound. Not taking any leveraged positions here. Weekly open (white) is acting as support now. Both sides of the range have been tapped often enough now to serve as good levels playable on a break and retest.” The stability in the price of Bitcoin and the sideways market of crypto have negative affected the short-term price trend of small market cap tokens, which usually benefit from the stability of the dominant cryptocurrency. Decred, Power Ledger, Loom, Qtum, and Aeternity recorded losses in the range of 5 to 10 percent as the worst performing cryptocurrencies in the global market on October 25. The volume of Bitcoin is low but the daily trading volume of tokens and small market cap cryptocurrencies are continuing to record yearly lows. Tokens could initiate a strong recovery as they have done throughout 2018 if BTC recovers with solid volume. In the weeks to come, analysts do not expect investors to engage in high-risk trades. Ripple and Bitcoin Cash Struggling In recent months, Ripple (XRP), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), EOS, and Stellar (XLM) have demonstrated a price trend which reflects that of tokens and small market cryptocurrencies. The four major cryptotucrrencies recorded losses in the range of 1 to 3 percent against the US dollar. In the upcoming days, it is likely for the crypto market to see stability in the price of BTC and a gradual increase in its volume until BTC tests a major resistance level in the higher region of $6,000.

      "A gang of Call of Duty players is suspected of masterminding a plan to steal more than $3 million in cryptocurrency. Citing unsealed court documents, the Chicago Sun-Times reports that the group — which includes a Dolton, IL man and a man from Bloomington, IL — is alleged to have hacked into cryptocurrency wallets after gaining access to the victims’ phones. ‘Forced to Cooperate’ According to an application for a warrant to search the Dolton man’s home, the Bloomington man informed the FBI that he met members of the group online while playing warfare simulation video game Call of Duty. He claimed that they forced him to partake by “SWATing” him– a slang that means raising a false alarm about a crime purportedly happening at a given address to trigger a response from law enforcement. He added that members of the group gave him details of victims to enable him to take over more than a hundred phones with the ultimate aim of stealing funds from the victims’ crypto wallets. The practice, known as “SIM hijacking” is becoming increasingly widespread as it is relatively low-tech with potentially high rewards if the stolen phone numbers are linked to crypto wallets. CCN recently reported that Bitcoin investor Michael Terpin sued AT&T for $224 million after losing $24 million worth of cryptocurrency to so-called SIM hijackers who managed to transfer his telephone number and subsequently reset the password to his crypto wallet. The FBI affidavit shows that San Francisco-based Augur reported on December 12, 2016, that their investors and employees were being targeted by cryptocurrency thieves. Augur’s protocol runs an online betting platform where a wide range of betting options exist using cryptocurrency. FBI Gets Involved Names of the suspects listed in the affidavit have not been mentioned and they have not been charged with any crimes yet. According to the FBI, the gang is suspected of stealing at least $3.3 million in various cryptocurrencies including about $805,000 worth of REP tokens by moving stolen tokens through cryptocurrency exchanges and mixers before sending them to their own wallets in the form of ether and bitcoin. Court records show that FBI agents were at the Dolton man’s home on August 1, seizing phones and computers. They interviewed the Bloomington suspect in March 2017. The affidavit contains transcripts of messages exchanged online between suspected ring members. The unnamed Bloomington man has told the Chicago Sun-Times in an online interview that he considers himself a victim in the matter. He claims to have never profited from crypto-hacking, stating that he has always cooperated with Augur and the FBI, and that the number of phones he helped to hack was substantially less than 100.

      "Indian authorities have arrested the co-founder of Unocoin, an upstart Bitcoin exchange in India. According to Times of India, Harish BV, co-founder of Unocoin, was taken into custody for illegally operating the “first” Bitcoin ATM in the world’s second-largest nation, located in Bangalore. The BTM was located in the Kemp Fort Mall. Bitcoin ATM Not Even Working At Time of Arrest As earlier reported, Unocoin had been taking baby steps in the implementation of its cash-to-coin (and vice versa) operations. They wrote on Twitter: Our Machine didn’t go well with few mainstream media reports who projected it under a negative light. The machine is still under final testing mode and it will be up and running in the upcoming week. People in the cryptosphere are no strangers to the dangers of toxic misinformation. Another founder of Unocoin, Sathvik Viswanath, told the media that the BTM was not actually even running at the time of Harish BV’s arrest. It was in “final testing mode.” A likely source of the police involvement was mall management, as according to Viswanath, the mall’s management had recently become uneasy about the BTM’s presence. The reason for panic is because of fake videos on Kannada and English channels. Due to this, our kiosk is not operational. We’ve been trying actively to get these videos pulled down. The Struggle Ahead for Crypto India Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are hardly new, but every country and culture have taken their own paths to adoption and acceptance. Government policy on the subject is extremely important in this regard, and the Indian government appears to be like most governments: decidedly not in favor and in some ways vehemently against. Viswanath pointed to specific remarks from earlier this year from the Indian Finance Minister Arun Jaitely specifically stated that bitcoins are not “legal tender” in India and that the government would work diligently to prevent cryptos from being used in “illegitimate” activities. Viswanath is quick to point out that not qualifying as legal tender does not make Bitcoin an illegal asset. The minister’s statement was clear: cryptocurrencies are not legal tender in India. He did not say ‘illegal tender.’ There’s a huge difference. It means you bear the risk of your investment and there’s no regulation for the industry. Nevertheless, a crypto businessman sits in jail today, with local police using the media to discourage people from engaging in Bitcoin activity and promising more arrests. His firm offers an Android wallet, a liquid market for Ether and Bitcoin, and it is with some degree of irony that as recently as June they were writing in defense of US regulatory practices as regards Bitcoin. Like anything else, government over-reaction to cryptocurrencies and bullying leads to black markets, which are exactly the sort of thing the government has promised to mitigate. As such, the Indian LocalBitcoins market appears strong, with apparently better rates for acquisition. LocalBitcoins is more of a “gray” market, with peers incurring their own risk in making in-person trades on a daily basis the world over. Featured image from Shutterstock.\n",

      "Cryptocurrency web wallet provider Blockchain has struck a deal with hardware wallet producer Ledger to manufacture a custom hardware device that will allow Blockchain users to seamlessly manage their online and offline funds through a single familiar interface. Unveiled on Thursday, the Blockchain Lockbox, is, according to an announcement, a “first-of-its-kind hardware and software” solution. Leveraging the strengths of both companies, the Lockbox will provide Blockchain users with a way to move a portion of their funds offline, further securing them from hacks, while also having the option to leave funds in the firm’s non-custodial web wallet, which can be accessed apart from the hardware device. “The Lockbox is a reflection of what our companies both do best. We’ve created an elegant software and hardware integration that offers more functionality than previously existed in our space. We’re thrilled to offer the Lockbox to Blockchain users so they can easily manage their funds online and offline seamlessly,” said Peter Smith, CEO and co-founder of Blockchain. The device appears to utilize Ledger Nano S hardware, though it features custom Blockchain firmware rather than the standard version. Ledger said that deliveries of the device, which is now available for preorder for $99.99, should begin in mid-November. “With stories about crypto hacking continuing to dominate headlines, it’s obvious that security must be top of mind for all stakeholders in the crypto space,” added Pascal Gauthier, president of Ledger. “With the combined forces of Blockchain and Ledger, users are truly getting the best of both worlds. Our partnership with Blockchain is the first of its kind, but as two companies hyper-focused on crypto security, it’s one that’s a natural fit.” Notably, the announcement said that existing Ledger customers will have the option to pair their Nano S wallets to the Blockchain wallet, providing them with the abilities to manage their online and offline funds together as well as access Blockchain’s inter-wallet trading feature. Trezor, another large cryptocurrency hardware wallet manufacturer, recently updated its wallet management interface to allow users to trade between cryptocurrencies via brokerage services ShapeShift and Changelly. However, both Ledger and Trezor could soon face a stiff challenge from electronics giant Sony, who, as CCN reported, this week unveiled a cryptocurrency hardware wallet system that it said it plans to “commercialize” in the future. Sony’s wallet, which is the size of a credit card, uses contactless IC technology to store private keys offline while allowing users to easily sign transactions from NFC-enabled mobile devices.

      "Electronics giant Sony has developed technology that it believes will help cryptocurrency users store their assets more securely, and that technology might just be coming soon to store near you. The Japanese tech conglomerate this week announced that its Computer Science Laboratories division (Sony CSL) had developed a cryptocurrency hardware wallet that could be used to store bitcoin and other digital assets in a secure offline environment while retaining the convenience of less-secure online crypto storage systems. Unlike conventional cryptocurrency hardware wallets like the Trezor One and Ledger Nano S, which connect to the user’s PC or mobile device using a USB cord, Sony CSL’s wallet would store the user’s private keys on a contactless IC card, enabling the user to easily sign transactions from an NFC-enabled mobile device. Sony explained: “This IC card type hardware wallet is small, portable and useful, unlike typical existing hardware wallets that connect to PCs via USB. In addition, it is possible to securely generate and store a private key with a highly reliable tamper-proof module within the IC card.” The release further noted that this type of wallet card would have “multiple possible applications,” including allowing a user to sign a blockchain transaction authorizing the use of their personal information. Perhaps most notably, Sony’s development of cryptocurrency tech does not appear to be a mere research project, or, as is often the case, an instance of a company seeking to position itself as an innovator in cutting-edge technology, even though it has no plans to convert its research into real-world products and applications. Earlier this year, Sony applied to patent a system that uses blockchain technology for digital rights management (DRM). Just this month, the company unveiled the production version of that system, which will build on Sony Global Education’s already-existent DRM platform for sharing educational data. In its latest announcement, the firm said it plans to work toward the “commercialization” of its cryptocurrency wallet, with the ultimate aim of furthering the spread of blockchain technology. The company said, “Sony CSL will continue advancing towards the commercialization of that ‘cryptocurrency hardware wallet technology’ that allows for safe and secure transactions of digital assets including cryptocurrencies with the aim of further…adoption of blockchain technology.” Featured Image from Shutterstock\n",

      "Cayman Island-based fintech startup Caspian has completed an eight-figure ICO ahead of schedule. Founded earlier this year, Caspian ties together the biggest cryptocurrency exchanges in a single user interface. The full-stack crypto asset management platform also offers compliance, algorithms, portfolio management, risk, and reporting. Its co-founders David Wills and Robert Dykes plan to channel 40 percent of the raised $19.5 million towards research and development. The other 25 and 15 percent would go towards sales & marketing and application support, respectively. The founders have also allocated a considerable sum towards building new partnerships, managing accounts and legal, and miscellaneous administration costs. “Selling out the crowd sale is a huge milestone in the growth of our company and our journey to build the first institutional grade full-stack crypto trading and risk management platform for professional traders and investors,” Willis said of the platform, now production-ready. “Caspian is a critical tool to assist the rapidly growing number of financial institutions seeking to trade cryptocurrencies.” The news arrives at a time when a majority of ICO rounds have failed to raise capitals for their blockchain projects. The bearish mood of the crypto market has further made it difficult for projects to attract funds. Caspian nevertheless has managed to strike the right chords among investors for plenty of reasons. Clients and Partners Caspian is serving to the need for tools that could simplify crypto trading for an always-rising influx of investors. The platform explicitly targets institutional grade users, including crypto trading companies and hedge funds. Caspian claims to have 170 customers waiting to sign up on its platform. The company has already added 15 names to its onboarding process, including Lykke, Bletchley Park, and ex-Point 72 manager Travis Kling’s Ikigai Asset Management. Caspian has also added 15 global institutions, including Techemy, Blockstars, OSL, and Galaxy Digital, which are live and trading on its platform. US-based crypto exchanges Coinbase and Gemini have also entered a strategic partnership with Caspian, which will enable them to offer its sophisticated trading and portfolio management functionalities to their customers. Hong Kong-based p2p crypto exchange BitMEX has also integrated Caspian for the same services. Notable crypto figures like Mike Novogratz, Mona El Isa, and Ari Paul have also joined the Cayman Islands startup as advisors. “Cryptocurrencies will play an increasingly big role with institutional players, yet to date, the sophisticated trading and portfolio management tools have not been available for this asset class,” Mona predicted. “It is exciting to see Caspian fill this gap with high-quality crypto-tools.” Featured image from Shutterstock.

CCN urges readers to conduct their own research with due diligence into the company, product or service mentioned in the press release. Available now on Android and iOS, the free app offers cryptocurrency holders a better user experience, with virtual financial asset banking, transfer, investment, and more. QORMI, MALTA (Oct. 15, 2018) — Noomi Wallet, a brand new, cryptocurrency banking application developed by a dedicated team of blockchain experts, officially launched today for Android and iOS devices. The digital wallet, which aims to make cryptocurrency in everyday life a mainstream reality, is designed to be both practical and easy to use. Serious crypto investors now have a place they can invest their virtual financial assets, or VFAs, in high-yield Bitcoin and Ethereum accounts. And thanks to the streamlined user interface, it’s the perfect app for crypto fans to introduce their family, friends, and associates — i.e. those who may not be as familiar with or comfortable using crypto — to the emerging world of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other VFAs. Among the core features: Invest and grow your VFAs — Open a Bitcoin or Ethereum investment account with fixed, guaranteed APRs. Support for all your VFAs — Noomi already supports some of the world’s most popular cryptocurrencies, which you can store safely in this easy-to-use wallet. These include Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH) and ERC20 tokens, CyberMiles Token (CMT), and more to come. Instant and free transfers and withdrawals — Instantly transfer VFAs to your friends on Noomi for free. W allet staking (coming soon) — Noomi is the first—and only—way for people who don’t have CMT cubes to participate still in block rewards and staking. These features offer immediate value to users and are the first part of an overall vision of building a compelling VFA services solution for the blockchain ecosystem: “Cryptocurrency is giving rise to new ways of interacting with money and commerce,” Andrew Dao, CEO of Noomi said. “There are countless promising new blockchains and tokens being launched that strive to innovate entire industries, unlock new value for users, and create something better and unique. We believe the innovation and creativity of this blockchain-based ecosystem will evolve the way business, commerce, and finance is done, a change that cannot happen overnight.” In addition to its primary VFA banking and payment transfer functions, Noomi sets itself further apart from other crypto wallets on the market by: Empowering users to invest their BTC and ETH like fiat. Noomi works with VFA managers to let users deposit VFAs into investment accounts, with guaranteed returns, great rates (6-10 percent p.a.), and short investment periods (14-30 days). Enabling usernames that you can remember. In addition to a standard wallet address, all Noomi users can choose a unique username for themselves and share that name with other users so that they can send or request cryptocurrency from you instantly. Erasing gas fees. Within the Noomi network, users can send cryptocurrency to each other instantly and for free. When sending outside the Noomi network, Noomi will pay the gas fee* for the supported VFAs. Eliminating the need to have a separate wallet app for different cryptocurrencies. Store and manage all of them in the Noomi Wallet, it’s as simple as that. Furthermore, Noomi’s team is in the process of applying for the Malta government-issued license to store, transfer and manage VFAs, making it one of the first crypto wallets in the world in full compliance with Malta VFA laws and regulations. “Our goal for Noomi is not only to support a new blockchain ecosystem, but also to assist the transition from traditional to blockchain-based practices by providing the critical layers of banking, payment processing, and investment services that tie it all together,” Dao said. “Moreover, we’re doing it in a way that benefits the people and businesses who are pioneers in this change. This app of ours is the first step.” Noomi has partnered with CyberMiles, a new public blockchain for e-commerce, as part of the CyberMiles ecosystem. Noomi is one of more than two dozen “Supernode” candidates for the CyberMiles’ blockchain, which is set for release this week. This strategic move is intended to position Noomi as not only a leader in the VFA services space but also a critical link in the DPoS consensus protocol that will power the CyberMiles network. “Till now, blockchain technology has been geared largely toward technical advancements or improvements like public ledgers and smart contracts,” Dr. Lucas Lu, founder, and CEO of the CyberMiles Foundation said. “While more and more people hear about cryptocurrency every day, few of us actually own it. Its potential to revolutionize how we pay, share information, and even how we interact with each other is yet to be realized. Expanding our ecosystem, we’re confident about paving the way for regular consumers to experience the benefits of cryptocurrency like never before.” Noomi already has undergone a professional security audit to ensure the safety of the VFAs held by the wallet and the users’ personal information. To learn more about the Noomi Wallet, go to noomiwallet.com, or join Noomi’s Telegram community at t.me/noomiofficial. *For a limited time only, Noomi is offering zero gas fees on any ERC20 token transaction from a Noomi user to a non-Noomi user. While CMT will be included as well, ETH and BTC transactions do not qualify for this promotional period. About Noomi Wallet Noomi was created to make virtual financial asset management and investment easy, secure, and most importantly, profitable. Our team of blockchain experts have banded together to build the best-in-class virtual financial asset investment and management platform that combines the traditional wallet with investment features to help you earn more no matter how the market is performing. Building on our team’s experience partnering with successful blockchain projects, we are offering an innovative new way for users to manage their virtual financial assets.

      "A 23-year-old woman has been arrested by the Sydney police for stealing $65,000 worth cryptocurrencies from a 56-year-old man. Brisbane Times reported that the woman hacked the victim’s email account in January 2018. She used the two-step verification feature by changing the password and verifying it with her mobile number. She then sent 100,00 XRP to her account in China from the crypto accounts connected to the email account. The XRP were converted into Bitcoins and transferred to multiple e-wallets. The victim was able to acquire his account after two days, however, the woman had drained all his funds by that time. Arthur Katsogiannis, Cybercrime Squad commander, said, “It’s a very significant crime and it’s the first we know of its type in Australia where an individual has been arrested and charged for the technology-enabled theft of cryptocurrency.” Katsogiannis said that even though this crime is the first of its kind, it will become a norm in the coming years. He added that such incidents will prove to be dangerous for investors interested in cryptocurrencies. news.com.au reported that the Public Order and Riot Squad (PORS) caught the woman at her parent’s house in Ebbing and seized all of her electronic devices. The woman is set to appear at Burwood Local Court on November 19. Crypto Crimes Continue to Haunt Authorities Last month, Oklahoma police arrested two men for allegedly stealing $14 million worth CMCT tokens from blockchain-based IT company Crowd Machine. The men got hold of the victim’s SIM card and replaced it with a fake one to use the former to access the crypto wallet. In September 2018, Japanese crypto exchange Zaif lost 6.7 billion yen ($60 million) worth cryptocurrencies stored in hot wallets. This hack bore a resemblance to crypto exchange Coincheck’s hacking incident earlier this year. The exchange lost $530 million worth NEM stored in hot wallets, while the funds stored in cold wallets remained safe. Following the hack, the Financial Services Agency (FSA) of Japan sent business improvement orders to 6 crypto exchanges including Zaif. Japan’s National Police Agency (NPA) recently published a report which explained that 158 crypto crimes were reported in the first half of 2018 alone. The agency added that 60% of these cases occurred due to the use of similar account and password details in various online accounts. With a total of 60 billion yen (approximately $534 million) stolen this year, XRP and BTC are considered the most targeted cryptocurrencies. Featured image from Shutterstock.\n",

      "The value of bitcoin hit an all-time high of nearly $20,000 in December 2017. Less than a year later, however, its value has dropped to about $6,400, according to digital-currency website CoinDesk, whose Bitcoin Price Index tracks prices from several key exchanges. Still, even though bitcoin is worth a lot less today than it was at its peak, if you invested $1,000 five years ago, you would have made a profit. While the value of one bitcoin hit highs of around $1,000 and lows below $600 during December 2013, when the cryptocurrency began to go mainstream, it hovered around $1,000 early in the month. A bitcoin purchased at $1,000 would be worth about $6,400 Thursday, or over six times as much, and your total gain would be over $5,000. This estimate does not include any additional fees or transaction costs. If you bought bitcoin at its high near $20,000, $15,000, or even at $10,000, though, you would have lost money: around $13,600, $8,600 or $3,600, respectively. CoinDesk: Bitcoin Price Index from Oct. 25, 2013, to Oct. 25, 2018 Volatility is pretty common for cryptocurrencies. Ethereum, once valued near $1,300, according to digital-currency tracker coinmarketcap, is now hovering around $200. Digital currencies XRP and Litecoin have seen similar declines. Thats part of the reason seasoned investors say to use caution when approaching crypto. Billionaire entrepreneur Mark Cuban and \"Oracle of Omaha\" Warren Buffett, for example, have both warned that bitcoins value is unstable. Legendary investor and Vanguard founder Jack Bogle, at a Council on Foreign Relations event, told the audience, \"Avoid bitcoin like the plague.\"\n",

      "TrueUSD (TUSD), Circle Coin (USDC), Gemini Dollar (GUSD), and Paxos (PAX), new generation stablecoins competing against Tether (USDT), are all based on the Ethereum blockchain network. Crucially, all of the three above mentioned stablecoins are fully audited, transparent, and regulated, which allow them to obtain stable banking services and guarantee the ability of consumers to redeem the tokens based on a 1:1 ration with the US dollar. Ethereum-Based Tokens Deploying a stablecoin on top of the Ethereum blockchain protocol instantaneously improves the compatibility of the asset with existing infrastructure. For instance, users of GUSD, PAX, and TUSD can utilize hardware wallets like Trezor and Ledger along with software wallets such as Metamask to send and receive stablecoins. “Improved send and receive. Two Ethereum wallets can quickly send and receive any amount of USDC at any time of day. Large transfers for business purposes become as easy as small e-commerce payments. Consumers can use the Coinbase app to send USDC to someone, while remaining confident the value is stable,” the Coinbase team explained, which recently integrated USDC with Circle. It also allows exchanges to easily integrate stablecoins without the necessity of creating a new infrastructure to support stablecoins. The Coinbase team emphasized that the usage of the Ethereum blockchain network enables developers to program the dollar, which allows fintech companies to develop programs that can easily and securely facilitate stablecoin transactions. “A programmable dollar. For developers and fintech companies, a digital dollar like USDC is easier to program with. For example, given the private keys for USDC, a program can easily send and receive them back and forth using the public Ethereum blockchain.” Most importantly, with stablecoins launched on Ethereum, users can track the circulation of the tokens with block explorers like Etherscan. Because the tokens are stored in smart contracts, users can track the amount of US dollars stored in a particular stablecoin, increasing the overall transparency of the currency. Subsequent to its launch, the Gemini team heavily emphasized the fact that GUSD is built on the Ethereum network with compliance with the ERC20 token contract standard, due to the various benefits the compatibility with Ethereum can provide. “To date, there has been no trusted and regulated digital representation of the U.S. dollar that moves in an open, decentralized manner like cryptocurrencies. Enter the Gemini dollar — a stable value coin (often called a “stablecoin”) that is (i) issued by Gemini, a New York trust company, (ii) strictly pegged 1:1 to the U.S. dollar, and (iii) built on the Ethereum network according to the ERC20 standard for tokens.” Cryptocurrency is in a Growth Curve The cryptocurrency market and industry are in a growth curve. In the years to come, as infrastructure surrounding the cryptocurrency market strengthens, opaque, inefficient, and unregulated platforms, assets, and projects will be replaced with more practical, transparent, and regulated alternatives. The stablecoin market has seen the emergence of new competitors against Tether that are transparent, regulated, and compliant with the existing infrastructure in the market.

      "Despite the year-long bear market that has seen the prices of major cryptocurrencies drop 70 to 80 percent, the demand for blockchain developers is still at an all-time high. According to Mehul Patel, the CEO of San Francisco tech talent recruitment firm Hired, the demand for the blockchain has increased significantly in the past several months. The supply of software engineers is already low, and individuals that are well versed in the cryptocurrency sector are even more scarce. “There’s a ton of demand for blockchain. Software engineers are in very short supply, but this is even more acute and that’s why salaries are even higher.” Interview Requests Every Day Speaking to CNBC, software engineer Dustin Welden, who currently works as an engineer for Globys, stated that immediately after he changed his job title from software engineer to principal blockchain engineer, he began to receive interview requests from both startups in the blockchain sector and major conglomerates on a daily basis. Welden said: “When my title became ‘principal blockchain engineer,’ it became relentless. I get interview requests every day on LinkedIn now.” For large-scale conglomerates like IBM, Deloitte, and Microsoft, it is of utmost importance to form a competent team that is able to expose the conglomerate to the blockchain sector when the time is right. To enter an emerging sector in a timely manner, corporations need to have individual talent in place to swiftly push the venture of the firm into the market. Hired CEO Patel emphasized that the mindset of conglomerates to plan a long-term strategy to target the cryptocurrency sector has led to an increase in demand for distributed ledger technology engineers. “There’s a mindset here of taking a long-term view of planning. If you’re going to build blockchain technology, you have to get that talent.” Blockchain Engineers are Rare The rise of the initial coin offering (ICO) market in 2017 has enabled individual developers to create decentralized applications (dApps) and blockchain systems by securing capital from the public within a short period of time. Crypto projects have been raising millions of dollars in the span of minutes from investors in the public cryptocurrency exchange market, regardless of regulatory hurdles implemented by leading markets such as the US and South Korea. “I don’t know any good Ethereum developer that isn’t a millionaire — There’s a gold rush among developers to learn the coding language of money,” Aragon CEO Luis Cuende, who raised $29 million within 2 minutes to build an Ethereum-based governance system, said. The massive amount of capital that is available to developers in the ICO market has encouraged developers to create their own blockchain systems and products, rather than being appointed as a full-time developer with a stable paycheck. But, with the salary for blockchain engineers surpassing that of AI engineers and specialists at around $170,000 per year, in the months to come, tech recruitment firms expect an influx of distributed ledger technology engineers to join major conglomerates to streamline the process of commercializing the technology and decentralized systems.

      "Over the last 24 hours, the volume of Bitcoin has increased by yet another 10 percent from $3.5 billion to around $3.8 billion. On October 28, the volume of Bitcoin increased by around 20 percent from $3.1 billion to $3.5 billion, showing strong and sustainable momentum in the lower region of $6,000 for the first time since mid-September. Still Low Volume, But What Happened in November? As cryptocurrency investor and technical analyst Hsaka recently stated, the volume of Bitcoin has declined to the October 2017 level. Trading activity in the cryptocurrency exchange market has subsided due to the stagnant price movement of major cryptocurrencies. The decline in momentum of Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, Bitcoin Cash, and EOS have affected the performance of small market cap tokens and digital assets. But, in October, a drop in daily trading volume and a stagnant few months led to a short-term surge in price for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other major cryptocurrencies, allowing the market to achieve a valuation of $800 billion. Since August 9, the price of Bitcoin failed to escape a tight range from $6,300 to $6,600 apart from one occasion in mid-September, and an increase in volatility in the weeks to come could enable the market to achieve positive sentiment prior to the end of 2018. “If you squint hard enough, you can see the $BTC weekly candle. $85 spread between the high and low of the week (as of now). Last time we had lesser volume than this was Oct ’17. Hopefully we see some semblance of volatility into the weekly close,” Hsaka wrote. DonAlt, a cryptocurrency trader, stated that in the days to come, Bitcoin will likely retest $6,200, as it fell below its support level at $6,400. “Finally a movement. And as I guessed right as I’m about to leave for vacation, as always. Looking for a daily close at the edge of the green zone. Intraday a retest of 6200 still very possible.” BCH, XRP, and ETH Down 4% Heavily impacted by the two percent drop in the price of BTC over the past three hours, Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Ripple (XRP), and Ethereum (ETH) declined by more than 4 percent, recording a steep decline for the first time since early October. BCH and EOS recorded a more intense drop in comparison to other major cryptocurrencies, as the two assets often reflect the movement of small cryptocurrencies and tokens during a market downtrend. While the state of the market depends on the speed of the recovery of BTC, analysts generally believe that the crypto market will initiate a fast corrective rally in the days to come, particularly because the sell-off of major assets were triggered without a large spike in volume. The sell-pressure on most digital assets remain less intense than in August and September, which could allow the market to rebound relatively quickly in the short-term.

      "Over the past 11 days, the Bitcoin price has remained stable in the range of $6,300 to $6,500, struggling to initiate a major movement on the upside. The volume of Bitcoin has declined substantially over the last 72 hours from $3.6 billion to $3.1 billion on CoinMarketCap, by nearly 20 percent. Trading activity in the cryptocurrency exchange market has generally subsided, as investors have started to avoid taking high-risk, high-return trades in a period of uncertainty. Support and Resistance Merging: Where is Bitcoin Headed to Next? Since early August, for nearly three months, Bitcoin has shown a record high level of stability. The dominant cryptocurrency has not seen such a low level of volatility spread out across several months in recent history, even during the aftermath of the 2014 correction. Bitcoin has stabilized in the lower price range to the point in which its support and resistance levels started to merge. Previously, respected cryptocurrency trader Peter Brandt stated that the short-term price trend of Bitcoin can be considered as a classic Wyckoff hinge behavior, which could lead to a major short-term rally for the asset. However, Willy Woo, a prominent cryptocurrency analyst and operator of Woobull.com, stated that based on various technical indicators including the NVT Ratio, the cryptocurrency market is likely to be in the middle of a long-lasting bear market. “If you’re into timing games, then my own NVT Ratio is saying we are still in the middle of a bear market. NVT is simply the ratio of volume carried by the blockchain to the historic price. (This indicator is due for recalibration after the Liquid Sidechain launch). Woo added that the correlation between network volume and market cap of major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin could serve as an accurate indicator to measure the depth of the current bear market, referring to the NVT chart published on Woobull.com below. “This is the chart that NVT is based upon; the historically tight correlation between the value transmitted by the chain (network volume) and network value (market cap). The deviation we are going through right now are clues to how much of a bear market we are in.” If the cryptocurrency market is in fact in the midst of a long-lasting bear market, it does not mean that a large drop is in play. It is possible for BTC to demonstrate another substantial drop in the long-term but given the level of stability it has demonstrated throughout the past three months, a drop below the $6,000 support level is highly unlikely. Where is Bitcoin Headed to? In the days to come, the price of Bitcoin is expected to remain in the tight range of $6,400 to $6,500 due to its low volume. But, a major catalyst could send the price of the asset up to the $6,800 mark, a major resistance level which the asset has not been able to test since September. Featured Image from Shutterstock.

(Photo: Getty Images) If bitcoin use continues to grow, it alone could produce enough carbon emissions to raise global temperatures by almost 4 degrees F as soon as 2033, a new study suggests. “Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency with heavy hardware requirements,\" said Randi Rollins, a master’s student at the University of Hawaii Manoa and study co-author. “And this obviously translates into large electricity demands.” Bitcoin and other similar, power-hungry cryptocurrencies are assets that exist in digital form only and are created and exchanged independent of banks or governments. New bitcoins are created or \"mined\" by computers that solve complex mathematical problems. The bitcoins are then stored in \"digital wallets\" – a type of virtual bank account but without anything resembling deposit insurance – from which they can be tapped to buy things. Transactions take place and are recorded in computers around the world in a public ledger. You can buy coins on cryptocurrency \"exchanges.\" This whole process uses a LOT of electricity. In fact, just last year, bitcoin use produced 69 million tons of carbon dioxide, about equal to that of Austria. Carbon dioxide and methane are the primary greenhouse gases that have caused the Earths atmosphere to warm to levels that cannot be explained by natural causes, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The study authors found that if bitcoin is incorporated even at the slowest rate at which other technologies have been incorporated, its emissions will be enough to warm up the planet above 3.6 degrees F (2 degrees C) in just 22 years. If incorporated at the average rate of other technologies, Earth could reach that level in only 16 years. More: Fear of missing the boat on bitcoin? Youre not alone More: Bitcoin, other digital currencies suffer another big drop as risks rise “Currently, the emissions from transportation, housing and food are considered as the main contributions to ongoing climate change,\" said Katie Taladay, also a student at the University of Hawaii-Manoa and co-author of the paper. “In our paper, we show that bitcoin should now be put in the list of additional concerns.\" However, according to Bloomberg News, these concerns could be overblown. Cryptocurrency is nowhere near mainstream yet, and bitcoin is hardly used in everyday life, Bloomberg reported. It would be unfair to compare potential bitcoin adoption with previous consumer-technology, according to Bloombergs Michael Wilshire. Still, study lead author Camilo Mora said that “with ever-growing devastation from climate hazards, humanity is coming to terms that climate change is as real and personal as it can be. Clearly, any further development of cryptocurrencies should critically aim to reduce electricity demand, if the potentially devastating consequences of 3.6 degrees F (2 degrees C) of global warming are to be avoided.\" The study was published Monday in the peer-reviewed British journal Nature Climate Change.

      "Stock market darling Advanced Micro Devices appears to be a darling no more. The company, which makes microchips to power PCs and servers as well as video graphics cards, saw its share price shrivel by almost 25% in trading just on Wednesday through midday on Thursday. It’s been a wild ride this year for investors in AMD, which—regardless of the market gyrations—has been benefitting from a long-term chip redesign effort under CEO Lisa Su. AMD shares ended 2017 at $10.28, rose above $34 last month, and have since sold off considerably to trade at $19.40 midday on Thursday. At the height, AMD’s shares had more than tripled. Now they have fallen a total of 43% from that recent high, hit back on Sept. 13. The immediate catalyst for the sell-off this week was the company’s third quarter earnings report on Wednesday, along with the general market weakness among tech stocks. AMD’s revenue increased 4% to $1.65 billion for the quarter, slightly short of Wall Street analyst estimates, but the company’s forecast of $1.45 billion for fourth quarter revenue, which would represent an 8% gain, was a deeper miss versus Wall Street expectations. Still, the real story of AMD’s highs and lows is a complex tale related to the growth of its revamped line up of chips for PCs, servers and graphics, the ups and downs of the cryptocurrency market, and the stumbles of primary competitor Intel. To start, Su oversaw a wholesale redesign of AMD’s chip lineup to focus on higher performance that started delivering new products last year and saw second generation updates go on sale in 2018. Strong reviews and solid sales of the Ryzen chip for PCs, Epyc server chips, and Vega graphic chip drove AMD’s sales through the first nine months of this year to $5.1 billion, up 29% from the same period of last year. That’s also produced a net income of $299 million versus a loss of $14 million in 2017. But some of the sales boost had little to do with new products and resulted instead from the unsustainable boom in cryptocurrencies. People who wanted to crunch the calculations that lead to the creation of new digital coins, known as digital currency miners, often rely on graphics cards using chips from AMD and Nvidia (nvda). As cryptocurrency prices peaked, demand for graphics cards shot up. But lately prices have slumped and the resulting drop in demand showed up in AMD’s third quarter results. AMD said graphics chip sales related to mining made up almost 10% of sales total revenue in the third quarter last year, or about $150 million, versus almost nothing in this year’s quarter. That fall off was steeper than Wall Street, and maybe some AMD executives, expected. The final issue driving AMD’s stock price has been all of the problems at Intel, which lost its CEO in June and has been struggling to move its manufacturing process to cutting-edge techniques for several years. Intel admitted at the end of July that its much delayed 10-nanometer chip line, first expected to arrive back in 2015, wouldn’t be available in high volumes until the end of next year. AMD’s shares closed at $18.94 the day before Intel’s announcement and subsequently spent the next six weeks skyrocketing as investors dreamed that Intel’s delay would open the door for a massive sales increase. Lately, Intel (intc) has been offering more optimistic information and releasing chips that, at least on paper, appear to be strong competitors for AMD’s (amd) products, with or without the 10-nanometer process. A part of the disappointment with AMD’s third and (projected) fourth quarter revenue stemmed from a failure of the company to cash in quite as significantly as some hoped from Intel’s troubles. As longtime chip industry analyst Stacy Rasgon at Bernstein Research summed up in a report on Thursday: “It is clear that expectations got significantly overheated over the last few months, and now must come back down to earth, with the question of ultimate earnings power (and what one wants to pay for it) remaining up in the air even if the core businesses are on track.”\n",

      "As U.S. stock markets went haywire this week, the major cryptocurrency known for giving investors whiplash was surprisingly calm. Bitcoin is up 1 percent for the week as of Friday afternoon, according to data from CoinDesk, and remained in the $6,500 range without much fanfare. Equity markets were a different story — the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down almost 3 percent for the week. It ended 500 points higher on Thursday after plummeting a day earlier, then on Friday dropped more than 500 points after some disappointing quarterly results from key tech companies. It later recovered some of that drop. Fears of an ongoing trade war and rising interest rates added to the sell-off. But Bitcoins insulation from the market wreckage is relatively new. Earlier in October, uncertainty around stock markets bled into cryptocurrencies as the Dow dropped as much as 1,300 points in two days, its biggest sell-off since February. Bitcoin dropped 6 percent as the total cryptocurrency market during that time lost $18 billion of its value. Bitcoin has lost more than 65 percent of its value since nearing a high of $20,000 last year, when retail investors were fanatically pouring into the asset class. The cryptocurrency is still up 14 percent year over year, and was trading near $6,483 Friday, according to CoinDesk. Its volatility has made it almost impossible to use as a viable payment method. Instead bitcoin has been billed as a store of value, or \"digital gold.\" That safe haven use case also seemed unlikely at certain points this year, as it fell alongside major stock markets. Gold, a more established safe-haven asset, was up 0.6 percent this week.\n",

      "Mount Kenya provides visitors with a picturesque appeal reminiscent of the ambiance in a world of utopia. Beyond the charm and aura lies a tech-savvy Kenyan restaurant that has incorporated cryptocurrencies for facilitating payment. Betty’s place puts its culinary skills into effective use in “nyama choma,” a tantalizing goat meat barbeque that many Kenyans savor. Situated in the rural town of Nyeri, roughly 150km (90 miles) from the sprawling federal capital, Nairobi, it is one of the few startups in the country that has embraced blockchain technologies by allowing customers make payment with two cryptocurrencies – Bitcoin and Dash. The Proprietress of the restaurant enthused on her ability to latch onto the big picture. “Since the world is becoming more global, my place is also becoming a global restaurant,” she said. The dividends of her ingenuity include the traffic of visitors who stop by at her restaurant from different parts of the world. “I attract different customers from different parts of the world, whichever coin they have. As long as it’s a viable coin, we accept it.” Ms. Wambugu ventured into trading in Bitcoin some years back, and within the space of 24 months, her working capital became large enough to purchase the two-story Nyeri hotel which she renamed Betty’s Place. Strategically located along Nyeri’s major road axis, Betty’s Place has a commanding aesthetic appeal with its bright mustard-colored walls and magnificent windows. The design itself is a luring invitation to the libido that wells in the stomach. Hungry patrons fall to the bait of such irresistible aroma of meat on the grill. When you add the melodious symphony of the Kenyan orchestra, you can imagine why many have found the place as a resort. Bitcoin Tutorials Betty’s Place is not just a place where you enjoy the unique culinary cuisine of Kenyans, and it is also becoming a citadel for learning the rudiments of Bitcoin. Ms. Wambugu prides herself as a crypto-currency pioneer, and it will be out of place if she is faulted since she is putting her nous into effective use. She introduced tutorial sessions on bitcoin for interested individuals, and the classes hold every Sunday at her restaurant. “I’ve set aside one day where I can teach my customers. Whoever asks about cryptocurrencies: How does it work? What is Bitcoin? I train them.” she said. Blockchain Technology Used In Housing Scheme Cryptocurrency adoption in Kenya keeps rising despite a recurrent warning by the country’s apex bank, advising its citizens on the dangers of dealing with digital assets. While the country’s central bank has warned citizens against cryptocurrencies, the State’s Housing and Urban Development has rolled out plans to incorporate blockchain technology for the distribution of Government housing units. The latest innovation is aimed at developing a scheme that will efficiently allocate houses using sophisticated ledger for proper management. Featured image from Shutterstock.\n",

      "A case involving almost half a million dollars in cryptocurrency led to an important new precedent in China. A high Chinese court, the Court of International Arbitration, ruled that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are valuable personal property and are therefore protected under existing Chinese law. The court also stated that there is no law on the books prohibiting the possession or acquisition of cryptos. A plaintiff, who was not named in any reportage, brought suit against a person he’d hired to steward and trade his coins for him. A deadline for return of the coins was scheduled, and the defendant missed the deadline. The balances in question were 20 Bitcoin, 70 Bitcoin Cash, and just over 12.5 Bitcoin Diamond. The defense had a seemingly strong argument: the contract between the parties was invalid when China decided to ban ICOs and crypto trading. According to the defendant, this legal stance makes all crypto transactions illegal and therefore the contract was outside the bounds of a court’s enforcement authority. The court disagreed with this interpretation, and according to a Chinese news source, the following conclusion was drawn: The bitcoin return contract concluded between private individuals does not violate the mandatory provisions of the legal and regulatory effects and should not be considered invalid. Chinese laws and regulations do not prohibit privately held and legally transferred bitcoin. Further, although cryptos are a digital asset, “it does not prevent it from becoming an object of delivery.” As a result of the case, the defendant was forced to pay 100,000 Yuan in damages in addition to returning the coins. Important Cryptocurrency Precedent Courts are important in the People’s Republic, so much so that they will hear cases even when the court room is flooded. Cryptocurrency has long been a gray area around the world, particularly in China, where rumors of a Bitcoin ban have frequently led to market turbulence elsewhere. Despite being apparently legal, there have been several incidents where the government has taken action against operations it deemed as being improperly regulated. Such cases have often had global implications. We can speculate a few things as a result of this case. One, the case for cryptocurrencies is far from settled. While ICOs and exchanges have been shut down or banned and many have found ways to adapt, including Binance which was moved operations to Malta, there seems to be hope that Chinese cryptonaughts will in the future have several legal methods of utilizing Bitcoin. At present time, according to this ruling, which can be challenged later by an even higher court, private individuals are free to use Bitcoin amongst themselves. Two, the Chinese government is not uniformly opposed to cryptos. We in the cryptocurrency space expect central banks and even private banks to do what they can to impede the progress of digital monies, but it appears that in a legal sense, they are not all-powerful. If people can still hold coin in China, then there is hope that over time they will once again be able to legally participate in every other way. Featured image from Shutterstock.\n",

      "The fast-growing blockchain technology sector has created a high demand for talent and this has consequently resulted in blockchain engineers being among the best-remunerated in the tech sector. According to CNBC, the average pay for blockchain engineers in the United States is between US$150,000 and US$175,000 making it comparable to what developers who specialize in another high-demand field, artificial intelligence, make. The two fields now currently offer the highest-earning specialized engineering roles. Typical software engineers make an average of US$135,000. Surge in Openings This comes at a time when the job postings requiring blockchain technology skills have increased dramatically. For instance, Hired, a San Francisco, California-based tech sector recruitment firm which provided CNBC with the salary stats in the tech sector, has seen a 400% increase in the job postings seeking employees with blockchain technology skills since late last year. “There’s a ton of demand for blockchain. Software engineers are in very short supply, but this is even more acute and that’s why salaries are even higher,” Hired’s CEO, Mehul Patel, told the business news TV channel. This is similar to a finding by jobs site Glassdoor which saw job listings related to blockchain and cryptocurrencies increase by 300% in August 2018 compared to the same period last year. In the United States, most of the blockchain-related jobs are located in New York City (24%) and San Francisco (21%). Outside the United States the top-five cities with the highest number of blockchain-related job openings were London (16%), Singapore (7%), Toronto (7%), Hong Kong (6%) and Berlin (4%). Top Destinations for Blockchain Talent Per Glassdoor, some of the top-hirers are startups such as Circle, Kraken, Figure, Coinbase and ConsenSys though established firms such as Oracle, IBM, KPMG and Accenture also feature in the top ten. The findings by Hired and Glassdoor also echo a similar conclusion drawn by leading freelance jobs website Upwork. As CCN reported two months ago, blockchain was the fastest growing freelance skill on the telecommuting platform in the United States for the second consecutive quarter. The 2018 Q2 Upwork Skills Index also showed an increase in demand for individuals proficient in the programming languages and frameworks that are required to fill blockchain developer or engineer positions. Upwork: Blockchain the Fastest Growing Skill in US Freelance Job Market https://t.co/lCAj3jXzSx — CCN (@CryptoCoinsNews) August 4, 2018 Some of the programming languages required in the blockchain technology field include Go, Python, JavaScript and Java. The C++ programming language, which is the language employed in coding the most commonly used client of bitcoin, Bitcoin Core, is also considered fundamental. Solidity, a language created by the Ethereum project team specifically for writing smart contracts, is also required in the blockchain sector. Featured image from Shutterstock.\n",

      "Craft brewery BrewDog, known in the UK for operating a chain of drinking pubs for hipsters, has opened a bar in Canary Wharf, London, that accepts not only bitcoin but also changes its markup based on the movement of the Financial Times Stock Exchange 100 Index (FTSE). According to a report on the Drinks Business, the FTSE induced pricing will be exclusively implemented on a “special beer tap.” Due to the location of the bar, which overlooks Bellmouth Passage and the canal linking old North and the South Docks, known for trading, the company says the pricing of the beer will vary based on how the market is doing. If the FTSE goes up, the price of the beer goes on with it. If it falls, you will have an endless supply of beer at a steep discount. Before BrewDog, entrepreneurs Alan Grant and Glenn Burgess created the Reserve Bar Stock Exchange, an automated stock market for booze, three years ago. At the time, Grant had said that “alcohol doesn’t have to be sold at an extortionate rate.” In an official blog post, BrewDog said the new location would also be the first of its bars to accept cryptocurrencies, allowing consumers to pay for their spirits using bitcoin or bitcoin cash and the second cashless bar under the company’s domain. The company advised consumers to come with their credit cards and their Equity Punk ID Card, a form of loyalty card that allows holders to redeem discounts at any of BrewDog’s location. In addition to the grand opening of the Canary Wharf bar, BrewDog will also run a bitcoin cash giveaway, promising to give the first 100 attendees a BCH wallet pre-loaded with crypto between £12 and £100. Earlier this month, Mr. Wolf’s , a nightclub in Bristol had an event where customers were allowed to pay for a pint of beer with bitcoin for the night. Mr. Wolf’s was ecstatic about the one-off event, which was done to support the documentary of two movie producers and prove that bitcoin could be a viable currency in a society that is fast becoming cashless.

CCN urges readers to conduct their own research with due diligence into the company, product or service mentioned in the press release. Available now on Android and iOS, the free app offers cryptocurrency holders a better user experience, with virtual financial asset banking, transfer, investment, and more. QORMI, MALTA (Oct. 15, 2018) — Noomi Wallet, a brand new, cryptocurrency banking application developed by a dedicated team of blockchain experts, officially launched today for Android and iOS devices. The digital wallet, which aims to make cryptocurrency in everyday life a mainstream reality, is designed to be both practical and easy to use. Serious crypto investors now have a place they can invest their virtual financial assets, or VFAs, in high-yield Bitcoin and Ethereum accounts. And thanks to the streamlined user interface, it’s the perfect app for crypto fans to introduce their family, friends, and associates — i.e. those who may not be as familiar with or comfortable using crypto — to the emerging world of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other VFAs. Among the core features: Invest and grow your VFAs — Open a Bitcoin or Ethereum investment account with fixed, guaranteed APRs. Support for all your VFAs — Noomi already supports some of the world’s most popular cryptocurrencies, which you can store safely in this easy-to-use wallet. These include Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH) and ERC20 tokens, CyberMiles Token (CMT), and more to come. Instant and free transfers and withdrawals — Instantly transfer VFAs to your friends on Noomi for free. W allet staking (coming soon) — Noomi is the first—and only—way for people who don’t have CMT cubes to participate still in block rewards and staking. These features offer immediate value to users and are the first part of an overall vision of building a compelling VFA services solution for the blockchain ecosystem: “Cryptocurrency is giving rise to new ways of interacting with money and commerce,” Andrew Dao, CEO of Noomi said. “There are countless promising new blockchains and tokens being launched that strive to innovate entire industries, unlock new value for users, and create something better and unique. We believe the innovation and creativity of this blockchain-based ecosystem will evolve the way business, commerce, and finance is done, a change that cannot happen overnight.” In addition to its primary VFA banking and payment transfer functions, Noomi sets itself further apart from other crypto wallets on the market by: Empowering users to invest their BTC and ETH like fiat. Noomi works with VFA managers to let users deposit VFAs into investment accounts, with guaranteed returns, great rates (6-10 percent p.a.), and short investment periods (14-30 days). Enabling usernames that you can remember. In addition to a standard wallet address, all Noomi users can choose a unique username for themselves and share that name with other users so that they can send or request cryptocurrency from you instantly. Erasing gas fees. Within the Noomi network, users can send cryptocurrency to each other instantly and for free. When sending outside the Noomi network, Noomi will pay the gas fee* for the supported VFAs. Eliminating the need to have a separate wallet app for different cryptocurrencies. Store and manage all of them in the Noomi Wallet, it’s as simple as that. Furthermore, Noomi’s team is in the process of applying for the Malta government-issued license to store, transfer and manage VFAs, making it one of the first crypto wallets in the world in full compliance with Malta VFA laws and regulations. “Our goal for Noomi is not only to support a new blockchain ecosystem, but also to assist the transition from traditional to blockchain-based practices by providing the critical layers of banking, payment processing, and investment services that tie it all together,” Dao said. “Moreover, we’re doing it in a way that benefits the people and businesses who are pioneers in this change. This app of ours is the first step.” Noomi has partnered with CyberMiles, a new public blockchain for e-commerce, as part of the CyberMiles ecosystem. Noomi is one of more than two dozen “Supernode” candidates for the CyberMiles’ blockchain, which is set for release this week. This strategic move is intended to position Noomi as not only a leader in the VFA services space but also a critical link in the DPoS consensus protocol that will power the CyberMiles network. “Till now, blockchain technology has been geared largely toward technical advancements or improvements like public ledgers and smart contracts,” Dr. Lucas Lu, founder, and CEO of the CyberMiles Foundation said. “While more and more people hear about cryptocurrency every day, few of us actually own it. Its potential to revolutionize how we pay, share information, and even how we interact with each other is yet to be realized. Expanding our ecosystem, we’re confident about paving the way for regular consumers to experience the benefits of cryptocurrency like never before.” Noomi already has undergone a professional security audit to ensure the safety of the VFAs held by the wallet and the users’ personal information. To learn more about the Noomi Wallet, go to noomiwallet.com, or join Noomi’s Telegram community at t.me/noomiofficial. *For a limited time only, Noomi is offering zero gas fees on any ERC20 token transaction from a Noomi user to a non-Noomi user. While CMT will be included as well, ETH and BTC transactions do not qualify for this promotional period. About Noomi Wallet Noomi was created to make virtual financial asset management and investment easy, secure, and most importantly, profitable. Our team of blockchain experts have banded together to build the best-in-class virtual financial asset investment and management platform that combines the traditional wallet with investment features to help you earn more no matter how the market is performing. Building on our team’s experience partnering with successful blockchain projects, we are offering an innovative new way for users to manage their virtual financial assets.

      "Ripple Labs has unveiled their quarterly market report, and things appear positive overall. Between its two major operations, Ripple Labs and Ripple II, which caters to institutional investors and is fully licensed, the firm moved more than $160 million in ripple (XRP). Interestingly, these sales accounted for less than half a percent of the total volume of the market, meaning that trading in ripple has been on a volatile upswing. The ripple price has risen dramatically over time, currently sitting at over 40 cents a token. With a total market supply of some 100 billion tokens, the network as a whole is currently priced around $40 billion (though just $18.5 billion of those funds are currently in circulation). As with all crypto assets, however, liquidity for a figure of that sort is unlikely. Actual liquid cash convertible from XRP might be in the low hundreds of millions as opposed to billions. Nevertheless, this is a vast improvement over the days when it would have taken 200 XRP to make a dollar. Last year, Ripple locked up 55 billion of its own XRP supply to create stability in the trading markets. The move appears to have played well with the psychology of the cryptocurrency investment community. Over the past three months, 3 billion of that 55 billion have returned to the hands of Ripple, with 2.6 billion being thus returned to escrow. The report explains: “In Q3 2018, 3 billion XRP was again released out of escrow (1 billion each month). 2.6 billion XRP was subsequently put into new escrow contracts. […] The remaining 400 million XRP not returned to escrow is being used in a variety of ways to help support the XRP ecosystem.” An interesting factoid from the report is that for most of the third quarter of this year, Maltese exchanges led the way in terms of trading volume. “Over the last six months, Malta has proposed a number of rules that create a clear legal framework for the trading of digital assets. Additionally, Malta lets international companies pay as little as 5 percent in corporate taxes. Prime Minister Dr. Joseph Muscat has called cryptocurrencies ‘the inevitable future of money.’ This has led to a number of large crypto firms, including Binance and OKEX Technology, moving their operations to the Mediterranean island nation.” Ripple continues to be one of the leading digital currency outfits, and the firm touts regulatory compliance as its modus operandi. The firm has frequently butted heads with traditional cryptocurrency advocates due to its outspoken propensity for government oversight as well as claims that the network itself is centralized. Nevertheless, Ripple appears to be flourishing. Featured Image from Shutterstock. Charts from TradingView.\n",

      "Kim Dotcom, a German-Finnish Internet entrepreneur and a renowned investor in crypto, stated that the US economy will inevitably crash in the years to come. If US markets deteriorate in the long-term, as predicted by recognized economists including Peter Schiff and Nouriel Roubini, Dotcom firmly stated that crypto will appeal to investors as a robust and stable store of value alongside precious metals such as gold. “US Empire now pays half a trillion dollars in interest payments per year to service its debt. US debt increases by a trillion per year. It’s a death spiral that cannot be undone. Self-destruction and USD collapse are unavoidable. Get out of USD and US stocks. Buy gold & crypto.” Merit of Crypto As the most powerful economy in the world, the US economy has a significant impact on Asia and Europe. When US stock markets suffered their worst sell-off in recent years by deleting all of the gains made in 2018, analysts reported that Asia markets have become more vulnerable to a potential crash. Kathy Lien, managing director of FX strategy at BKAM, said: “It’s not in an environment of positive growth trend so the pressure will be exacerbated in the emerging markets compared to the U.S. market. Unfortunately, this is the beginning. I think that when we get sentiment shifts like these, they always last longer than we would like to see and we could see the selling continue for some time.” Therefore, if the US economy experiences a major crash by 2020 as many economists and major financial institutions like JPMorgan predict, then it will have a more drastic effect on stock, real estate, and financial markets in Asia. The debt problem of the US mentioned by Kim Dotcom has been shared by both economists and government agencies like the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which recently emphasized that the US has to stop ignoring the seriousness of its federal debt held by the public. “Even if you think that public debt just doesn’t matter to economic outcomes, the thing you have to admit is that when we hit a downturn, governments are less likely to take significant steps if the debt is as high as ours is now,” Jared Bernstein, a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, said Speaking to CNBC, Sonja Gibbs, senior director of the Capital Markets and Emerging Markets Policy Department of the Institute of International Finance, echoed the sentiment of Bernstine, stating that it will be more challenging for the US to stimulate growth and facilitate the expansion of its economy with its significant debt. Unprecedented Growth Rate of Crypto In the next 10 years, as the adoption of cryptocurrencies improves to a point in which merchants, retailers, and businesses embrace digital assets as a proper payment method, Dotcom added that then it will provide consumers with unparalleled financial freedom, increasing the value of digital assets. “Crypto is replacing fiat at an accelerating rate. It’s still early days but within 10 years you can pay all your bills, goods and services with crypto. No more bankers and politicians gambling with your money at the bullshit casino. Encryption + Crypto = Freedom,” he explained. Featured image from Shutterstock\n",

      "Three university scholars – two from the University of Florida and one from Princeton – have concluded what many veteran cryptocurrency enthusiasts have long known and loudly preached: pump-and-dump schemes are bad. In a new paper currently in progress by Tao Li, Donghwa Shin, and Baolian Wang, the scholars provide evidence that market manipulation schemes “are detrimental to the liquidity and price of cryptocurrencies.” CCN readers may have an interest in the context of the paper in relation to the recent activity at YoBit, in which the exchange itself openly promised to inject a ton of money into random coins in order to inflate their price. What Is A Pump-And-Dump Scheme? For the uninitiated, the term “pump-and-dump” might be foreign. Therefore we should first point out that these schemes did not begin with cryptocurrency and they will be around forever. That’s right: there is no eliminating the pump and dump scheme so long as people are free to make trading decisions on their own. In any case, a “pump” is when a great deal of value is injected into a given stock, symbol, or, in our case, cryptocurrency, in a market sense. A hype cycle is often involved, and new products are especially likely to be P&Ds. A lone investor with a lot of capital or a small group of colluding entities can make a huge difference in weak markets. The examples in the cryptosphere are endless. One or two bitcoins can purchase a large amount of literally thousands of different coins, and if there are only a few exchanges listing a given token, the “price” will see a significant rise. The “dump” part of the scheme is when the people acquiring the asset and necessarily driving its price to ridiculous highs sell off their stake to people who are none the wiser. The people buying at rates which previously would have been unreasonable believe they are buying long-term, solid assets. There is also a psychological element to both gambling and investing in which a dominant part of the human brain believes that things will be the way they are today tomorrow. The reality is that pump and dump schemes are hard to regulate without hard facts and informants because often enough, on the surface, they can appear like healthy boom-time trading. High-risk instruments trading has one goal: get out at the top, or nearest to the top that you can. Experienced traders understand that any asset can turn to absolute crap overnight. Traditional stocks can dive on the news cycle. The fundamentals are what matter. But with even more high-risk instruments, such as speculative technologies and the tokens that power them, the fundamentals are incredibly difficult to gauge. This reporter has dedicated a substantial portion of his life to covering the happenings around cryptocurrencies, tokens, and the like, and still he is overly cautious in most investments surrounding them due to the simple fact that the future is unwritten, and something entirely unexpected can overshadow the basket you dump all your eggs into. All of which is to say: trading amidst a pump and dump conspiracy is like being caught in a building victimized by arson. The arsonist is most likely to get out with barely even any smoke in his lungs, if he gets burned at all. The rest of the people suffer by degrees. The last person to sell loses the most money. Hype Is Important The hype cycle is important to most of these schemes, but it is not absolutely necessary for success. A pump-and-dump expert could potentially fool a market mostly made up of trading robots. Inside information such as the said bots’ trading triggers would help a great deal. A pump-and-dump scheme can go for weeks or months, or it can last a few days. Often, hundreds of smaller traders participate in private Telegram groups with the intent of making each other richer. As the scholars write: In the cryptocurrency market, manipulators often organize “pump groups” using encrypted messaging apps such as Telegram. They create Telegram channels and invite other investors to join. They frequently advertise on social media platforms to attract investors. A Telegram channel operator can post messages for other members to read. For a planned pump, the operator announces the target date, time, and exchange, usually at least one day in advance. However, they do not disclose the identity of the target token until the scheduled time. Members also receive multiple reminder messages before the announcement of the token symbol. As we show in this paper, a typical cryptocurrency P&D lasts for only several minutes. Therefore, it is reasonable to believe that Telegram channel members are important participants in P&Ds. What it really boils down to is having enough money and the know-how to raise the price of a given asset. We don’t use the word “value” because the actual value of a token is relative to much more than what people on markets are trading it for that day. As an example, if Bitcoin dove 75% again tomorrow, its actual “value” would probably not be reflected in the market price. Likely as not, it would cost more to mine it, for a time, than it would to buy it. But the value of Bitcoin is much more than what people are willing to pay for it at a given second. The price is a separate thing. The most successful schemes happen at the launch of a token or a coin and are perpetuated by the creators or “team” themselves. Entire blockchains have been created and abandoned in the pursuit of sometimes small amounts of Bitcoin. What Can Be Done? As earlier stated, pump and dump fraud is like any other unsavory activity: it will always be there. How much and how often it is allowed to affect the rest of society is where positive action is possible. The study done by the authors reviewed a specific case, Bittrex, and its tactics attempting to mitigate or eliminate pumping and dumping on its platform. The results were apparently positive in nature: Messages about pump groups on Telegram show that traders involved in P&D tactics had taken notice of the warning. Many scheduled P&D events were immediately canceled. For example, one prominent pump channel, “Trading signals for crypto,” canceled its P&D event on November 26, 2017. Some message groups solicited feedback from group members regarding whether to switch to other exchanges. Many message groups eventually ceased to pump tokens traded on Bittrex and/or switched to alternative exchanges such as Yobit. Another conclusion of the paper is that newcomers are often looted of their initial investment. Again, in so many ways crypto trading parallels gambling: a new poker player might be bullied off his small stake by insane bets on the part of a bluffing veteran, or simply not know what they are doing and lose their money that way. The major difference is that a gambler understands it’s a just a game, whereas most investors are earnestly trying to make money, and often they are influenced by false information or downright lies. Resultantly, there is and may for the foreseeable future be “significant wealth transfer” from newcomers to immoral scam artists masquerading as investors. And as long as there is a market for something, there will be a provider. We can’t stress enough how absurd it is for an exchange itself to openly “pump” coins at random, as Yobit have done. The next step is the exchange operators simply running off with the money, which has happened before. Perhaps it’s better than exchanges which do it on the sly, as most every exchange has been excused. Yet, there was long speculation that Crytpsy was pumping the price of Paycoin and other tokens using customer funds, and look what happened there. Featured image from Shutterstock.\n",

      "Stock market darling Advanced Micro Devices appears to be a darling no more. The company, which makes microchips to power PCs and servers as well as video graphics cards, saw its share price shrivel by almost 25% in trading just on Wednesday through midday on Thursday. It’s been a wild ride this year for investors in AMD, which—regardless of the market gyrations—has been benefitting from a long-term chip redesign effort under CEO Lisa Su. AMD shares ended 2017 at $10.28, rose above $34 last month, and have since sold off considerably to trade at $19.40 midday on Thursday. At the height, AMD’s shares had more than tripled. Now they have fallen a total of 43% from that recent high, hit back on Sept. 13. The immediate catalyst for the sell-off this week was the company’s third quarter earnings report on Wednesday, along with the general market weakness among tech stocks. AMD’s revenue increased 4% to $1.65 billion for the quarter, slightly short of Wall Street analyst estimates, but the company’s forecast of $1.45 billion for fourth quarter revenue, which would represent an 8% gain, was a deeper miss versus Wall Street expectations. Still, the real story of AMD’s highs and lows is a complex tale related to the growth of its revamped line up of chips for PCs, servers and graphics, the ups and downs of the cryptocurrency market, and the stumbles of primary competitor Intel. To start, Su oversaw a wholesale redesign of AMD’s chip lineup to focus on higher performance that started delivering new products last year and saw second generation updates go on sale in 2018. Strong reviews and solid sales of the Ryzen chip for PCs, Epyc server chips, and Vega graphic chip drove AMD’s sales through the first nine months of this year to $5.1 billion, up 29% from the same period of last year. That’s also produced a net income of $299 million versus a loss of $14 million in 2017. But some of the sales boost had little to do with new products and resulted instead from the unsustainable boom in cryptocurrencies. People who wanted to crunch the calculations that lead to the creation of new digital coins, known as digital currency miners, often rely on graphics cards using chips from AMD and Nvidia (nvda). As cryptocurrency prices peaked, demand for graphics cards shot up. But lately prices have slumped and the resulting drop in demand showed up in AMD’s third quarter results. AMD said graphics chip sales related to mining made up almost 10% of sales total revenue in the third quarter last year, or about $150 million, versus almost nothing in this year’s quarter. That fall off was steeper than Wall Street, and maybe some AMD executives, expected. The final issue driving AMD’s stock price has been all of the problems at Intel, which lost its CEO in June and has been struggling to move its manufacturing process to cutting-edge techniques for several years. Intel admitted at the end of July that its much delayed 10-nanometer chip line, first expected to arrive back in 2015, wouldn’t be available in high volumes until the end of next year. AMD’s shares closed at $18.94 the day before Intel’s announcement and subsequently spent the next six weeks skyrocketing as investors dreamed that Intel’s delay would open the door for a massive sales increase. Lately, Intel (intc) has been offering more optimistic information and releasing chips that, at least on paper, appear to be strong competitors for AMD’s (amd) products, with or without the 10-nanometer process. A part of the disappointment with AMD’s third and (projected) fourth quarter revenue stemmed from a failure of the company to cash in quite as significantly as some hoped from Intel’s troubles. As longtime chip industry analyst Stacy Rasgon at Bernstein Research summed up in a report on Thursday: “It is clear that expectations got significantly overheated over the last few months, and now must come back down to earth, with the question of ultimate earnings power (and what one wants to pay for it) remaining up in the air even if the core businesses are on track.”\n",

CCN urges readers to conduct their own research with due diligence into the company, product or service mentioned in the press release. Available now on Android and iOS, the free app offers cryptocurrency holders a better user experience, with virtual financial asset banking, transfer, investment, and more. QORMI, MALTA (Oct. 15, 2018) — Noomi Wallet, a brand new, cryptocurrency banking application developed by a dedicated team of blockchain experts, officially launched today for Android and iOS devices. The digital wallet, which aims to make cryptocurrency in everyday life a mainstream reality, is designed to be both practical and easy to use. Serious crypto investors now have a place they can invest their virtual financial assets, or VFAs, in high-yield Bitcoin and Ethereum accounts. And thanks to the streamlined user interface, it’s the perfect app for crypto fans to introduce their family, friends, and associates — i.e. those who may not be as familiar with or comfortable using crypto — to the emerging world of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other VFAs. Among the core features: Invest and grow your VFAs — Open a Bitcoin or Ethereum investment account with fixed, guaranteed APRs. Support for all your VFAs — Noomi already supports some of the world’s most popular cryptocurrencies, which you can store safely in this easy-to-use wallet. These include Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH) and ERC20 tokens, CyberMiles Token (CMT), and more to come. Instant and free transfers and withdrawals — Instantly transfer VFAs to your friends on Noomi for free. W allet staking (coming soon) — Noomi is the first—and only—way for people who don’t have CMT cubes to participate still in block rewards and staking. These features offer immediate value to users and are the first part of an overall vision of building a compelling VFA services solution for the blockchain ecosystem: “Cryptocurrency is giving rise to new ways of interacting with money and commerce,” Andrew Dao, CEO of Noomi said. “There are countless promising new blockchains and tokens being launched that strive to innovate entire industries, unlock new value for users, and create something better and unique. We believe the innovation and creativity of this blockchain-based ecosystem will evolve the way business, commerce, and finance is done, a change that cannot happen overnight.” In addition to its primary VFA banking and payment transfer functions, Noomi sets itself further apart from other crypto wallets on the market by: Empowering users to invest their BTC and ETH like fiat. Noomi works with VFA managers to let users deposit VFAs into investment accounts, with guaranteed returns, great rates (6-10 percent p.a.), and short investment periods (14-30 days). Enabling usernames that you can remember. In addition to a standard wallet address, all Noomi users can choose a unique username for themselves and share that name with other users so that they can send or request cryptocurrency from you instantly. Erasing gas fees. Within the Noomi network, users can send cryptocurrency to each other instantly and for free. When sending outside the Noomi network, Noomi will pay the gas fee* for the supported VFAs. Eliminating the need to have a separate wallet app for different cryptocurrencies. Store and manage all of them in the Noomi Wallet, it’s as simple as that. Furthermore, Noomi’s team is in the process of applying for the Malta government-issued license to store, transfer and manage VFAs, making it one of the first crypto wallets in the world in full compliance with Malta VFA laws and regulations. “Our goal for Noomi is not only to support a new blockchain ecosystem, but also to assist the transition from traditional to blockchain-based practices by providing the critical layers of banking, payment processing, and investment services that tie it all together,” Dao said. “Moreover, we’re doing it in a way that benefits the people and businesses who are pioneers in this change. This app of ours is the first step.” Noomi has partnered with CyberMiles, a new public blockchain for e-commerce, as part of the CyberMiles ecosystem. Noomi is one of more than two dozen “Supernode” candidates for the CyberMiles’ blockchain, which is set for release this week. This strategic move is intended to position Noomi as not only a leader in the VFA services space but also a critical link in the DPoS consensus protocol that will power the CyberMiles network. “Till now, blockchain technology has been geared largely toward technical advancements or improvements like public ledgers and smart contracts,” Dr. Lucas Lu, founder, and CEO of the CyberMiles Foundation said. “While more and more people hear about cryptocurrency every day, few of us actually own it. Its potential to revolutionize how we pay, share information, and even how we interact with each other is yet to be realized. Expanding our ecosystem, we’re confident about paving the way for regular consumers to experience the benefits of cryptocurrency like never before.” Noomi already has undergone a professional security audit to ensure the safety of the VFAs held by the wallet and the users’ personal information. To learn more about the Noomi Wallet, go to noomiwallet.com, or join Noomi’s Telegram community at t.me/noomiofficial. *For a limited time only, Noomi is offering zero gas fees on any ERC20 token transaction from a Noomi user to a non-Noomi user. While CMT will be included as well, ETH and BTC transactions do not qualify for this promotional period. About Noomi Wallet Noomi was created to make virtual financial asset management and investment easy, secure, and most importantly, profitable. Our team of blockchain experts have banded together to build the best-in-class virtual financial asset investment and management platform that combines the traditional wallet with investment features to help you earn more no matter how the market is performing. Building on our team’s experience partnering with successful blockchain projects, we are offering an innovative new way for users to manage their virtual financial assets.

      "While much of the world grapples with the development of crypto-related policy, Ukraine has become a first mover. The eastern European country has unveiled a path for the adoption of cryptocurrencies, with Ukraine’s Ministry of Economic Development and Trade beginning the process for the legalization of virtual assets, an endeavor that is projected to take three years. According to the announcement: “The Economic Development Ministry initiates the adoption of the concept of state policy in the field of virtual assets, the purpose of which is to create understandable conditions for conducting activities in the field of virtual assets and virtual currencies.” The government organization will set out to define key terms in the crypto space, including “virtual currency/cryptocurrency, virtual assets, ICO/ITO, mining, smart contracts and token,” according to local Ukrainian publication Ukrinform. In doing so, they will be giving developers and blockchain founders parameters for operating in the space, including the tens of thousands of crypto engineers that are engaged by Silicon Valley startups. It could also bolster the amount of international investment that is directed into Ukrainian blockchain startups. Crypto policy will be crafted over two stages that will unfold between now and 2021. Fits and Starts There have been greens shoots of crypto regulation in Ukraine for months, with one member of Parliament, Alexei Mushak, revealing in the spring that the path to the legalization of cryptocurrencies was in the works and at that time urging feedback from market participants. Mushak, who made the announcement on Facebook, held BTC as of 2016, according to public forums. Ukraine Drafts Law to Legalize Cryptocurrencies, Fuels Debate In Crypto Community https://t.co/Sg7tUis7vj — CCN (@CryptoCoinsNews) May 17, 2018 Mushak said at the time that the country was looking to establish transparency in the market, one in which blockchain development would be nurtured across sectors of the economy while holders of crypto would be protected from “unsubstantiated criminal prosecutions.” Meanwhile, the law will also be designed to fight fraud such as “money laundering and terrorism financing” that tends to be associated with an “underground” crypto market that was common in Ukraine under a different administration. Regulatory clarity remains elusive in the blockchain space, and Ukraine is ahead of many jurisdictions in its efforts. Separately, there are a couple of crypto-friendly bills being considered, one of which would lift taxes on crypto-related business for at least a decade, incentivizing both businesses and individuals to transact in cryptocurrencies. Ukrainians trade nearly $2 million in cryptocurrencies daily across approximately two-dozen coins, and hundreds of local merchants already accept altcoins as a payment method.

      "According to Yahoo! Finance, Coinbase has eliminated more than 15 people from its customer support, compliance, and fraud departments. All three of these departments would seem to be of the utmost importance to the company, often simultaneously lauded and maligned for its commitment to regulatory compliance. Daniel Roberts, author of the Yahoo! report, acquired confirmation that there had been firings but could not get an exact count from Coinbase. The number comes from an anonymous source, so could be more or less, but one thing is for certain: Coinbase definitely downsized more than a handful of people. Move Comes At A Time of Expansion Coinbase made no mention of the downsizing on its blog, and according to Roberts’ source, higher-ups at the firm are “handling communications poorly.” From our perspective, this news is somewhat odd, given that the company has recently appeared in good health and just this past week expanded its offerings for its institutional clients. Of course, financial health is not the only reason for positions to be eliminated. The report notes that most of the employees were remote workers. As it turns out, Coinbase would prefer to bring customer service and the other departments, as a whole, closer to home. Coinbase told Yahoo!: We’ve learned that certain teams who are co-located are more efficient, effective, and happier in their roles. So moving forward, some teams—including Support, Fraud, and Compliance—will only hire employees into Coinbase offices. Trading Down When The Market Is Down Cryptocurrencies have been on a downward slope for most of 2018, from the highs at the end of 2017 and the beginning of the year. Smart cryptocurrency people tend to “hodl” when prices are low, and so trading volume at Coinbase and across the market has seen a concurrent decline with perceived value of cryptos. According to the report, Coinbase layoffs have been expected by people at the company for some time now. It therefore makes good sense that remote employees in departments the company would prefer to have tighter control over would be the first to go. Some experts predict an upswing in the value of Bitcoin impending. If this comes to pass, most other cryptocurrencies will inherently trade at higher prices, even if their Bitcoin value is steady or only slightly inclined.\n",

CCN urges readers to conduct their own research with due diligence into the company, product or service mentioned in the press release. The ICC Gold-Backed Hedge Coin According to the statistics from CoinMarketCap, as of August 2018, the market value of global cryptocurrency has evaporated nearly 75%, whereas a bear market in the cryptocurrency sector has not yet come to an end. In a turbulent market like this, token holders are most afraid of reoccurring credential issues in ICO as well as the dramatic volatility in cryptocurrency prices. In this regard, what token holders currently call for is perhaps not new cryptocurrencies, but a hedge coin in the sector. Under such backdrop, GramGold Coin Collaboration (GGCC) skipped the controversial ICO (Initial Coin Offering) and completed ICC (Initial Coin Circulation) this September. A GramGold Coin (GGC), issued by GGCC, is a hedge coin with the underlying logical 1:1 ratio of 1 gram of physical gold. Our mission of issuing GGC is to become one of the top Hedge Coin providers, so that token holder can, not only have an alternative to go for in the fluctuating crypto market, but also a measure to obtain consistent stability. GGC’s operating model is to purchase physical gold from certified provider BullionStar, save it in world-class storage facilities, coin tokens on smart contracts with the PoA. Token holders holding GGC not only have a crypto token but under the consensus in the Blockchain, in fact, own an equal value to gold. In this way, token holders are able to reach stability and balance in their crypto portfolio. GGC will be on the world’s top 10 exchanges by the end of 2018. Why is Hedging a Must for Your Business? In 2018, the two most valuable cryptocurrencies in the world, Bitcoin and Ethereum, have taken their year-to-date losses to an eye-watering 50%. Until Sep. 15, 2018, Bitcoin has dropped 52.3% while Ethereum has crashed 71.9% compared to that on Jan. 1, 2018. If token holders wish to exchange crypto to fiat, an additional transaction fee to varying degrees will be charged by exchanges. Gold — the Best Hedging Tool for You Gold’s wealth preserving ability has withstood the test of time. Its prices have a low correlation to the market’s economic activities and have sustained a relatively stable price range. Such characteristics make gold the most reliable asset when the economy is in systemic crises. In the cryptocurrency market, one that is more volatile than traditional financial markets, a secure and valuable option is needed more than ever. GCC — Crypto Gold with Higher Flexibility and Security Each GGC is tokenized through a smart contract logically supported by a gram of physical gold with PoA, certified by world-class storages. With such a structure, token holders are able to enjoy stability through the Blockchain’s consensus system. The nature of gold enjoys higher flexibility in Blockchain than traditional markets. Token holders around the world can purchase such crypto asset anytime, anywhere. BullionStar works with Bureau Veritas, the world’s cutting-edge third-party auditing firm, to audit twice every year, and is 100% subscribed to world-class insurance company Chubb Insurance.

      "It’s been 10 years since bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto published his white paper on bitcoin, and the global economy hasn’t been the same since. The original cryptocurrency now boasts a market cap of more than $112 billion, while bitcoin’s dominance hovers at more than 53%. But if you ask Nigel Green, founder and CEO of financial advisory firm deVere Group, which boasts $10 billion in AUM, the next 10 years will look a lot different than bitcoin’s first decade. He’s quick to attribute the “crypto revolution” to bitcoin, saying that it has changed the way money is transacted forever. Green’s outlook, however, is a mixed bag, with bitcoin’s “influence and dominance of the cryptocurrency sector” expected to “drastically reduce” while the value of the broader crypto market is poised to expand by 5,000%, which would attach a combined market cap of $20 trillion in the coming decade. Green stated in a press release: “[While] I don’t wish to rain on anyone’s parade, I believe that Bitcoin’s influence and dominance of the cryptocurrency sector will drastically reduce in its second decade. This is because as mass adoption of cryptocurrency grows, more and more digital assets will be launched – by organizations in both the private and the public sectors. This will increase competition for Bitcoin and dent its market share.” Ripple (XRP) and ETH to Steal Bitcoin’s Shine Green, whose firm is based in Dubai but has offices around the world, pointed to other reasons for the forecast, such as better technology, features, and solutions to problems that competing cryptocurrencies will provide, coins like ripple (XRP) and ethereum. He told CCN: “I believe that…XRP will be one of the main digital assets to dent Bitcoin’s market share over the next few years due to its apparent focus on integrating with banks and other financial institutions.” XRP already muscled ETH out of the No. 2 spot for cryptocurrencies on CoinMarketCap more than once this year, though it has since fallen back to the No. 3 spot. Meanwhile, despite the fact that ETH has fallen out of favor with the crypto community of late, Green remains bullish on the future though he falls short of calling for a “flippening” event. “Another one would be its current main challenger Ethereum. This is because a growing number of platforms are adopting Ethereum as a means of trading; there’s an increasing use of smart contracts by Ethereum; and due to the decentralization of cloud computing.” Even if bitcoin’s dominance fades, Green says there is a clear shift among retail and institutional investors away from fiat money and into crypto, one whose momentum will only intensify in the coming decade. As a result, he expects “the market will have grown beyond recognition when Bitcoin celebrates its 20th anniversary.” Featured Image from Shutterstock\n",

      "Coinbase has made yet another pioneering move in the regulatory morass that is cryptocurrency. The company today announced that its institutional wing, Coinbase Custody Trust Company, has received approval from New York State regulators to operate as an “independent Qualified Custodian.” Coinbase May Operate as Qualified Custodian A qualified custodian operates similarly to a bank, so much so that it is sometimes referred to as “custodian bank,” in that it is authorized to hold money for other people. In general, the purpose of a custodian is to minimize theft and/or loss of funds. Coinbase is among the first cryptocurrency firms to achieve this status, with BitGo having recently received approval from the South Dakota Division of Banking to operate as a qualified custodian as well. Coinbase Custody Trust Company is legally a separate company from Coinbase. This means its funds and accounts will be organized separately from existing capital and funds held by Coinbase. The move does not affect everyday users of Coinbase products, although larger holders may find they have new options and products available to them in the coming months. It remains to be seen if Coinbase will seek approval from other jurisdictions, such as the EU, for similar licensing. According to the New York Department of Financial Services announcement, the firm is also legally authorized to protect crypto assets. According to Coinbase, this is an important addition for their clients, the vast majority of whom use the firm to be sure they are legally transacting in the cryptocurrency space. On their blog, the company wrote: “For our customers, operating under a New York State Trust Company is more than just a new license — it’s an important piece of regulatory clarity that will allow us to compliantly store more assets and add new features like staking.” The keyword here is compliance. While many in the Bitcoin community still take issue with the “Bitcoin bank” business model or the influx of traditional financial operators into the crypto space, plenty of newer converts and people interested in cryptocurrency have a much greater fear of government reprisal for the unregulated use of cryptocurrencies. The move also adds a degree of accountability to Coinbase in terms of holding a great deal of currency — with the new services they can offer larger clients they also now have a new range of penalties and investigative angles they are open to. Cryptocurrency No Longer a Fringe Asset Not so many years ago, to invest in Bitcoin was widely considered either foolhardy, overly idealistic, or downright outlandish. Today, however, there is no major financial firm nor entity which has not taken note of the plane-shifting asset class. The majority of them have active plans in place to deal with the new reality: blockchains are here to stay, and the tokens that power them are mighty valuable. Folks like veteran banker Jamie Dimon may continue to disparage cryptos while quietly strategizing to profit from them, but today’s smart money knows better than to believe his epithets. Coinbase has, since its inception, understood what cypherpunks might prefer to minimize or ignore: Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have the best chance of survival when governments do not actively have them in their crosshairs. The establishment and licensure of Coinbase Custody is only the company’s latest move in line with this philosophical realism. Images from Shutterstock\n",

      "Jakarta, Indonesia, Oct. 23, 2018: Noorcoin launched its application demo for 57 Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) member countries in the annual session of the Islamic Chamber of Commerce, Industry & Agriculture (ICCIA) of the OIC on October 22-23 2018 in Jakarta. OIC is the second largest inter-governmental organization after the United Nations. The meeting is attended by the delegation from 57 OIC member countries. Noorcoin Founder and CEO, Sofia Koswara said, “OIC member countries, such as Brunei and Kingdom of Saudi Arabia as the guardian of two most holy cities with pilgrims from all over the world, was very serious about using Noorcoin. Banks in Saudi Arabia to the Zakat Council in the country began to think about the use of digital money as an alternative to long-term financial transactions. We believe once the application demo is completed, Noorcoin will reach acceleration in a few months.” Noorcoin COO, Thomas Yudhistira said, “The purpose of the application demo is not only to test the technological issue, but also the cultural and legal environment in each 57 OIC member countries. For example, there is a widespread misconception towards cryptocurrency in the Middle East due to the notion that it is against Sharia law. Muhammad Abu Bakar (certified Muslim legal expert) in a report says that cryptocurrencies are permissible under Sharia law. Noorcoin is developed with sharia compliance in mind so we are positive that we would be compliant to national sharia regulations, which to be proven with this testnet.” Noorcoin CBDO, Iskandar Purnomohadi said, “The application demo was run using Ethereum Virtual Server and Ethereum Ropsten Testnet before full implementation and transition on Zilliqa blockchain platform around Q1 2019. This is to show Noorcoin’s mobile application demo’s potential and usability for the Muslim community. Also in a later stage after ICO, Noorcoin also plans to back its cryptocurrency with gold, to increase stability and security for its holders.” As part of the launching, Noorcoin was awarded by World Achievement Institute (LEPRID) as the First Shariah Token in the World with its Advanced Technology. World Achievement Institute’s Director and Founder, Paulus Pangka said, “Technology innovation which has a mass positive impact to billion population need to be recognized and supported. Noorcoin shariah token is really the trailblazer, eligible for a world record” Ambassador of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to Indonesia HE Osamh Mohammed Abdullah Shuibi who attend the launch to represent the country to accept Noorcoin D-app demo testnet said, “The use of digital money in Islamic countries is very important. In addition to facilitating transactions, the main objective is to reduce the dominance of the US dollar. Noorcoin, the first digital Islamic money, can be used for Umrah and Hajj services, as well as inter-state transactions. There are three advantages that Noorcoin has, namely transparent, safe and low cost. At present some countries are experiencing a weakening of the currency against the US dollar. We must have an alternative.” Previously, Indonesia Presidential Chief of Staff, General (Retd.) Moeldoko, as reported in the media, saw positively on the Noorcoin proposal. According to him, the unity of Islamic countries joined in the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) in the field of economics and trade must continue to be improved. Therefore, the momentum of ICCIA OIC can be a unifying force. ABOUT NOORCOIN: Noorcoin is the First Sharia Token in the world, building award winning sharia-compliant crypto-token and platform, decentralized trust and reputation system working flawlessly together through a blockchain based on-chain real-time payment gateway. We are creating a shariah-compliant, decentralized payment and trust solution on the Zilliqa blockchain leveraging smart contract technology.

      "TrueUSD (TUSD), Circle Coin (USDC), Gemini Dollar (GUSD), and Paxos (PAX), new generation stablecoins competing against Tether (USDT), are all based on the Ethereum blockchain network. Crucially, all of the three above mentioned stablecoins are fully audited, transparent, and regulated, which allow them to obtain stable banking services and guarantee the ability of consumers to redeem the tokens based on a 1:1 ration with the US dollar. Ethereum-Based Tokens Deploying a stablecoin on top of the Ethereum blockchain protocol instantaneously improves the compatibility of the asset with existing infrastructure. For instance, users of GUSD, PAX, and TUSD can utilize hardware wallets like Trezor and Ledger along with software wallets such as Metamask to send and receive stablecoins. “Improved send and receive. Two Ethereum wallets can quickly send and receive any amount of USDC at any time of day. Large transfers for business purposes become as easy as small e-commerce payments. Consumers can use the Coinbase app to send USDC to someone, while remaining confident the value is stable,” the Coinbase team explained, which recently integrated USDC with Circle. It also allows exchanges to easily integrate stablecoins without the necessity of creating a new infrastructure to support stablecoins. The Coinbase team emphasized that the usage of the Ethereum blockchain network enables developers to program the dollar, which allows fintech companies to develop programs that can easily and securely facilitate stablecoin transactions. “A programmable dollar. For developers and fintech companies, a digital dollar like USDC is easier to program with. For example, given the private keys for USDC, a program can easily send and receive them back and forth using the public Ethereum blockchain.” Most importantly, with stablecoins launched on Ethereum, users can track the circulation of the tokens with block explorers like Etherscan. Because the tokens are stored in smart contracts, users can track the amount of US dollars stored in a particular stablecoin, increasing the overall transparency of the currency. Subsequent to its launch, the Gemini team heavily emphasized the fact that GUSD is built on the Ethereum network with compliance with the ERC20 token contract standard, due to the various benefits the compatibility with Ethereum can provide. “To date, there has been no trusted and regulated digital representation of the U.S. dollar that moves in an open, decentralized manner like cryptocurrencies. Enter the Gemini dollar — a stable value coin (often called a “stablecoin”) that is (i) issued by Gemini, a New York trust company, (ii) strictly pegged 1:1 to the U.S. dollar, and (iii) built on the Ethereum network according to the ERC20 standard for tokens.” Cryptocurrency is in a Growth Curve The cryptocurrency market and industry are in a growth curve. In the years to come, as infrastructure surrounding the cryptocurrency market strengthens, opaque, inefficient, and unregulated platforms, assets, and projects will be replaced with more practical, transparent, and regulated alternatives. The stablecoin market has seen the emergence of new competitors against Tether that are transparent, regulated, and compliant with the existing infrastructure in the market.

      "At a meeting with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) commissioner Elad L. Roisman, representatives from SolidX, VanEck, and CBOE presented five major reasons why the commission should approve the Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) filing of VanEck and SolidX. VanEck, an investment management firm headquartered in New York that has decades of track record in the traditional finance sector and hundreds of ETFs filed under its name, outlined the following points the SEC should consider in approving its Bitcoin ETF: There now exists a significant regulated derivatives market for bitcoin Relevant markets – CBOE, bitcoin futures, OTC desks – are regulated Concerns around price manipulation have been mitigated, consistent with approval of prior commodity-based ETPs CBOE’s rules are designed to surveil for potential manipulation of Trust shares Promotes investor protection Significant Volume and Trading Activity in the Futures Market Previously, the SEC rejected the Winklevoss Bitcoin ETF primarily due to its reliance on a public cryptocurrency exchange in Gemini to find the base price of BTC. The SEC deemed cryptocurrency exchanges to be insufficiently regulated and liquid to handle an ETF. As a response to the rejection of the Winklevoss Bitcoin ETF, ProShares and two other companies filed 9 ETFs, basing the BTC price of the ETFs on the futures market operated by CBOE and CME Group. At the time, the filling of ETFs by the three companies was considered a smart move as it considered the SEC’s concerns regarding cryptocurrency exchanges. However, the SEC rejected the 9 ETFs and stated that the futures market is not of significant size to support an ETF. During its presentation, VanEck, SolidX, and CBOE representatives told the SEC that the futures market is able to handle the operation of an ETF through the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC), which was especially relevant given the involvement of CBOE in the filing. VanEck also emphasized that the approval of an ETF would reduce counterparty risk for investors and it would provide a simple solution for investors seeking price exposure, by increasing the stability of the market. “As of now, no CCPs support the clearing of bitcoin Investors are left facing absolute counterparty risk. Such risks are often unacceptable to many investors An ETF provides a straightforward solution for investors seeking price exposure without facing counterparty risk, as the ETF would be cleared through DTCC Furthermore, in creations and redemptions, the Trust always requires APs and trading counterparties to settle their leg of the trade before the Trust will do so.” The claim of VanEck directly supports the statement of SEC commissioner Hester Peirce, who previously stated that the current structure of the cryptocurrency exchange market only allows a selected group of investors with specific know-how and knowledge in the market to trade and benefit off of the liquidity in the market. “This complexity means that only a very particular type of investor can pursue the diversification opportunities such assets can provide. Entrepreneurs are developing new products through which people can access cryptocurrencies indirectly or hedge their cryptocurrency holdings. Bitcoin futures, for example, began to trade recently,” she explained. VanEck Has the Highest Chance Throughout the past several months, analysts have given VanEck and SolidX the strongest chance of having an ETF introduced in US markets given the history of VanEck in successfully filing hundreds of ETFs with the SEC.

      "The fast-growing blockchain technology sector has created a high demand for talent and this has consequently resulted in blockchain engineers being among the best-remunerated in the tech sector. According to CNBC, the average pay for blockchain engineers in the United States is between US$150,000 and US$175,000 making it comparable to what developers who specialize in another high-demand field, artificial intelligence, make. The two fields now currently offer the highest-earning specialized engineering roles. Typical software engineers make an average of US$135,000. Surge in Openings This comes at a time when the job postings requiring blockchain technology skills have increased dramatically. For instance, Hired, a San Francisco, California-based tech sector recruitment firm which provided CNBC with the salary stats in the tech sector, has seen a 400% increase in the job postings seeking employees with blockchain technology skills since late last year. “There’s a ton of demand for blockchain. Software engineers are in very short supply, but this is even more acute and that’s why salaries are even higher,” Hired’s CEO, Mehul Patel, told the business news TV channel. This is similar to a finding by jobs site Glassdoor which saw job listings related to blockchain and cryptocurrencies increase by 300% in August 2018 compared to the same period last year. In the United States, most of the blockchain-related jobs are located in New York City (24%) and San Francisco (21%). Outside the United States the top-five cities with the highest number of blockchain-related job openings were London (16%), Singapore (7%), Toronto (7%), Hong Kong (6%) and Berlin (4%). Top Destinations for Blockchain Talent Per Glassdoor, some of the top-hirers are startups such as Circle, Kraken, Figure, Coinbase and ConsenSys though established firms such as Oracle, IBM, KPMG and Accenture also feature in the top ten. The findings by Hired and Glassdoor also echo a similar conclusion drawn by leading freelance jobs website Upwork. As CCN reported two months ago, blockchain was the fastest growing freelance skill on the telecommuting platform in the United States for the second consecutive quarter. The 2018 Q2 Upwork Skills Index also showed an increase in demand for individuals proficient in the programming languages and frameworks that are required to fill blockchain developer or engineer positions. Upwork: Blockchain the Fastest Growing Skill in US Freelance Job Market https://t.co/lCAj3jXzSx — CCN (@CryptoCoinsNews) August 4, 2018 Some of the programming languages required in the blockchain technology field include Go, Python, JavaScript and Java. The C++ programming language, which is the language employed in coding the most commonly used client of bitcoin, Bitcoin Core, is also considered fundamental. Solidity, a language created by the Ethereum project team specifically for writing smart contracts, is also required in the blockchain sector. Featured image from Shutterstock.\n",

Available now on Android and iOS, the free app offers cryptocurrency holders a better user experience, with virtual financial asset banking, transfer, investment, and more. QORMI, MALTA (Oct. 15, 2018) — Noomi Wallet, a brand new, cryptocurrency banking application developed by a dedicated team of blockchain experts, officially launched today for Android and iOS devices. The digital wallet, which aims to make cryptocurrency in everyday life a mainstream reality, is designed to be both practical and easy to use. Serious crypto investors now have a place they can invest their virtual financial assets, or VFAs, in high-yield Bitcoin and Ethereum accounts. And thanks to the streamlined user interface, it’s the perfect app for crypto fans to introduce their family, friends, and associates — i.e. those who may not be as familiar with or comfortable using crypto — to the emerging world of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other VFAs. Among the core features: Invest and grow your VFAs — Open a Bitcoin or Ethereum investment account with fixed, guaranteed APRs. Support for all your VFAs — Noomi already supports some of the world’s most popular cryptocurrencies, which you can store safely in this easy-to-use wallet. These include Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH) and ERC20 tokens, CyberMiles Token (CMT), and more to come. Instant and free transfers and withdrawals — Instantly transfer VFAs to your friends on Noomi for free. W allet staking (coming soon) — Noomi is the first—and only—way for people who don’t have CMT cubes to participate still in block rewards and staking. These features offer immediate value to users and are the first part of an overall vision of building a compelling VFA services solution for the blockchain ecosystem: “Cryptocurrency is giving rise to new ways of interacting with money and commerce,” Andrew Dao, CEO of Noomi said. “There are countless promising new blockchains and tokens being launched that strive to innovate entire industries, unlock new value for users, and create something better and unique. We believe the innovation and creativity of this blockchain-based ecosystem will evolve the way business, commerce, and finance is done, a change that cannot happen overnight.” In addition to its primary VFA banking and payment transfer functions, Noomi sets itself further apart from other crypto wallets on the market by: Empowering users to invest their BTC and ETH like fiat. Noomi works with VFA managers to let users deposit VFAs into investment accounts, with guaranteed returns, great rates (6-10 percent p.a.), and short investment periods (14-30 days). Enabling usernames that you can remember. In addition to a standard wallet address, all Noomi users can choose a unique username for themselves and share that name with other users so that they can send or request cryptocurrency from you instantly. Erasing gas fees. Within the Noomi network, users can send cryptocurrency to each other instantly and for free. When sending outside the Noomi network, Noomi will pay the gas fee* for the supported VFAs. Eliminating the need to have a separate wallet app for different cryptocurrencies. Store and manage all of them in the Noomi Wallet, it’s as simple as that. Furthermore, Noomi’s team is in the process of applying for the Malta government-issued license to store, transfer and manage VFAs, making it one of the first crypto wallets in the world in full compliance with Malta VFA laws and regulations. “Our goal for Noomi is not only to support a new blockchain ecosystem, but also to assist the transition from traditional to blockchain-based practices by providing the critical layers of banking, payment processing, and investment services that tie it all together,” Dao said. “Moreover, we’re doing it in a way that benefits the people and businesses who are pioneers in this change. This app of ours is the first step.” Noomi has partnered with CyberMiles, a new public blockchain for e-commerce, as part of the CyberMiles ecosystem. Noomi is one of more than two dozen “Supernode” candidates for the CyberMiles’ blockchain, which is set for release this week. This strategic move is intended to position Noomi as not only a leader in the VFA services space but also a critical link in the DPoS consensus protocol that will power the CyberMiles network. “Till now, blockchain technology has been geared largely toward technical advancements or improvements like public ledgers and smart contracts,” Dr. Lucas Lu, founder, and CEO of the CyberMiles Foundation said. “While more and more people hear about cryptocurrency every day, few of us actually own it. Its potential to revolutionize how we pay, share information, and even how we interact with each other is yet to be realized. Expanding our ecosystem, we’re confident about paving the way for regular consumers to experience the benefits of cryptocurrency like never before.” Noomi already has undergone a professional security audit to ensure the safety of the VFAs held by the wallet and the users’ personal information. To learn more about the Noomi Wallet, go to noomiwallet.com, or join Noomi’s Telegram community at t.me/noomiofficial. *For a limited time only, Noomi is offering zero gas fees on any ERC20 token transaction from a Noomi user to a non-Noomi user. While CMT will be included as well, ETH and BTC transactions do not qualify for this promotional period. About Noomi Wallet Noomi was created to make virtual financial asset management and investment easy, secure, and most importantly, profitable. Our team of blockchain experts have banded together to build the best-in-class virtual financial asset investment and management platform that combines the traditional wallet with investment features to help you earn more no matter how the market is performing. Building on our team’s experience partnering with successful blockchain projects, we are offering an innovative new way for users to manage their virtual financial assets.

      "Throughout the past 24 hours, Bitcoin price seemed to be demonstrating momentum above the $6,400 mark, showing signs of a potential breakout. However, an abrupt fall from $6,430 to $6,370 put an end to the breakout, as BTC failed to breach a minor resistance level. With the volume of BTC at around $3.4 billion on CoinMarketCap, the chance of a major breakout in the next 24 to 48 hours remains relatively low. Stability of Bitcoin: Same Range Over and Over Again On October 15, heavily affected by speculation around Tether (USDT) triggered by the issues between Tether LLC and its US dollar bank, the price of the BTC-to-USDT pair rose to around $7,700 on Bitfinex. As a consequence, the Bitcoin price on fiat-to-cryptocurrency exchanges such as Coinbase, Bitstamp, and Kraken also surged substantially to around $6,800. Since then, the price of BTC has fallen to the range of $6,350 to $6,450, stuck in the same range for more than 10 days since October 16. The sudden increase in the price of BTC on October 15 from $6,120 to $6,800 served as an important short-term catalyst to drive the recovery of Bitcoin. Influenced by the price movement of BTC in mid-October, throughout the past week, BTC has been able to defend the $6,300 support level well despite its insufficient volume and low trading activity in the cryptocurrency exchange market. Cryptocurrency trader and technical analyst Hsaka emphasized that in a period like this, taking leveraged trades and high-risk options is of extreme risk and presents relatively low returns. “Still range-bound. Not taking any leveraged positions here. Weekly open (white) is acting as support now. Both sides of the range have been tapped often enough now to serve as good levels playable on a break and retest.” The stability in the price of Bitcoin and the sideways market of crypto have negative affected the short-term price trend of small market cap tokens, which usually benefit from the stability of the dominant cryptocurrency. Decred, Power Ledger, Loom, Qtum, and Aeternity recorded losses in the range of 5 to 10 percent as the worst performing cryptocurrencies in the global market on October 25. The volume of Bitcoin is low but the daily trading volume of tokens and small market cap cryptocurrencies are continuing to record yearly lows. Tokens could initiate a strong recovery as they have done throughout 2018 if BTC recovers with solid volume. In the weeks to come, analysts do not expect investors to engage in high-risk trades. Ripple and Bitcoin Cash Struggling In recent months, Ripple (XRP), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), EOS, and Stellar (XLM) have demonstrated a price trend which reflects that of tokens and small market cryptocurrencies. The four major cryptotucrrencies recorded losses in the range of 1 to 3 percent against the US dollar. In the upcoming days, it is likely for the crypto market to see stability in the price of BTC and a gradual increase in its volume until BTC tests a major resistance level in the higher region of $6,000.

      "Every now and then a major news outlet gets carried away and reports that Bitcoin will consume all the world’s power. A conspiracy theorist might say that such stories are instigated by the international banking cartels in order to stoke fears that Bitcoin is not a sustainable alternative to fiat currency, and recent findings by experts on the matter will do nothing to assuage such beliefs. The fact is, it’s not possible for Bitcoin to consume all the world’s power and moreover, the metrics used to reach such conclusions were faulty in the first place. Responding to an article published in Nature Climate Change and an earlier one published in Newsweek, a Dr. Jonathan Koomey has pointed out that the methodology used to make conclusions such as “Bitcoin mining on track to consume all of the world’s energy by 2020” or “Bitcoin emissions alone could push global warming above 2°C” is not sound. He writes: While I encourage everyone in the electricity sector to track Bitcoin as a potential source of new load growth, please use caution and avoid being misled by the hype. Breathless media coverage papers over the uncertainties in the underlying data, and makes it seem like Bitcoin is taking over the world, but in fact it’s likely only 0.1% of global electricity consumption, and it is unlikely to continue growing at recent historical rates. Also during his interesting response, he points out that Bitcoin is not the first technology to be targeted and vilified as an energy hog. He points to reporting from the early 2000s which asserted that the Internet as a whole was using more than 10% of the world’s electricity and that in fact these assertions were false, but it wasn’t for years that the claims were successfully debunked, largely because good science takes time and quality data collection is hard. “Misleading factoids about information technology electricity use emerged from coal-industry funded studies around the year 2000, at the time of the first dot com bubble and the California electricity crisis. They popped up again, from the same authors and funders, in 2005 and 2013,” he wrote. “The claims were reported in every major newspaper, cited by investment banking reports and politicians of both political parties, and avidly promoted by people and companies who should have known better […] All of these claims turned out to be bunk, but it took years of creating peer reviewed research to prove it. We found that the Internet (defined as those authors defined it) used only 1% of US electricity in 2000, all computers used 3%, the total would never grow to half of all electricity use, and that the factoid about the wireless Palm VII overestimated networking electricity by a factor of 2000.” Total Bitcoin Mining Power Usage? Less than 1% According to Koomey, total Bitcoin mining usage of the world’s electricity supply currently sits at about 0.1%. Importantly, it is not scheduled to continue growth at recent rates. While he says that Bitcoin is certainly an important factor for electric companies to consider as they expand operations, recent reporting on the subject does nothing to help. “It’s not a crisis, but we need more research.” It’s interesting how far misinformation can go. As we went to press with this story, the Washington Post published yet another article on the subject of Bitcoin being a bane to climate change. It would be useful if experts with countering opinions were consulted by such outlets from time to time. The Post writes: But the study then compared a hypothetical future rate of bitcoin adoption to the history of technologies such as the credit card, the dishwasher and electricity itself, and it found that if bitcoin continues to catch on — and if computations to record transactions and generate new bitcoin become ever more complex and demanding — greenhouse gas emissions from the mining could explode. Certainly, Bitcoin uses a lot of energy, but mining hardware also becomes more efficient with every new generation, and the amount of energy available in the world also increases regardless of Bitcoin. Such reporting around them seems to imply that the world would be better off – in a literal way – without Bitcoin. Such notions fail to take into account the many positive ways that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies can contribute to solving the world’s problems. Featured image from Shutterstock.\n",

      "Despite the year-long bear market that has seen the prices of major cryptocurrencies drop 70 to 80 percent, the demand for blockchain developers is still at an all-time high. According to Mehul Patel, the CEO of San Francisco tech talent recruitment firm Hired, the demand for the blockchain has increased significantly in the past several months. The supply of software engineers is already low, and individuals that are well versed in the cryptocurrency sector are even more scarce. “There’s a ton of demand for blockchain. Software engineers are in very short supply, but this is even more acute and that’s why salaries are even higher.” Interview Requests Every Day Speaking to CNBC, software engineer Dustin Welden, who currently works as an engineer for Globys, stated that immediately after he changed his job title from software engineer to principal blockchain engineer, he began to receive interview requests from both startups in the blockchain sector and major conglomerates on a daily basis. Welden said: “When my title became ‘principal blockchain engineer,’ it became relentless. I get interview requests every day on LinkedIn now.” For large-scale conglomerates like IBM, Deloitte, and Microsoft, it is of utmost importance to form a competent team that is able to expose the conglomerate to the blockchain sector when the time is right. To enter an emerging sector in a timely manner, corporations need to have individual talent in place to swiftly push the venture of the firm into the market. Hired CEO Patel emphasized that the mindset of conglomerates to plan a long-term strategy to target the cryptocurrency sector has led to an increase in demand for distributed ledger technology engineers. “There’s a mindset here of taking a long-term view of planning. If you’re going to build blockchain technology, you have to get that talent.” Blockchain Engineers are Rare The rise of the initial coin offering (ICO) market in 2017 has enabled individual developers to create decentralized applications (dApps) and blockchain systems by securing capital from the public within a short period of time. Crypto projects have been raising millions of dollars in the span of minutes from investors in the public cryptocurrency exchange market, regardless of regulatory hurdles implemented by leading markets such as the US and South Korea. “I don’t know any good Ethereum developer that isn’t a millionaire — There’s a gold rush among developers to learn the coding language of money,” Aragon CEO Luis Cuende, who raised $29 million within 2 minutes to build an Ethereum-based governance system, said. The massive amount of capital that is available to developers in the ICO market has encouraged developers to create their own blockchain systems and products, rather than being appointed as a full-time developer with a stable paycheck. But, with the salary for blockchain engineers surpassing that of AI engineers and specialists at around $170,000 per year, in the months to come, tech recruitment firms expect an influx of distributed ledger technology engineers to join major conglomerates to streamline the process of commercializing the technology and decentralized systems.

      "The fast-growing blockchain technology sector has created a high demand for talent and this has consequently resulted in blockchain engineers being among the best-remunerated in the tech sector. According to CNBC, the average pay for blockchain engineers in the United States is between US$150,000 and US$175,000 making it comparable to what developers who specialize in another high-demand field, artificial intelligence, make. The two fields now currently offer the highest-earning specialized engineering roles. Typical software engineers make an average of US$135,000. Surge in Openings This comes at a time when the job postings requiring blockchain technology skills have increased dramatically. For instance, Hired, a San Francisco, California-based tech sector recruitment firm which provided CNBC with the salary stats in the tech sector, has seen a 400% increase in the job postings seeking employees with blockchain technology skills since late last year. “There’s a ton of demand for blockchain. Software engineers are in very short supply, but this is even more acute and that’s why salaries are even higher,” Hired’s CEO, Mehul Patel, told the business news TV channel. This is similar to a finding by jobs site Glassdoor which saw job listings related to blockchain and cryptocurrencies increase by 300% in August 2018 compared to the same period last year. In the United States, most of the blockchain-related jobs are located in New York City (24%) and San Francisco (21%). Outside the United States the top-five cities with the highest number of blockchain-related job openings were London (16%), Singapore (7%), Toronto (7%), Hong Kong (6%) and Berlin (4%). Top Destinations for Blockchain Talent Per Glassdoor, some of the top-hirers are startups such as Circle, Kraken, Figure, Coinbase and ConsenSys though established firms such as Oracle, IBM, KPMG and Accenture also feature in the top ten. The findings by Hired and Glassdoor also echo a similar conclusion drawn by leading freelance jobs website Upwork. As CCN reported two months ago, blockchain was the fastest growing freelance skill on the telecommuting platform in the United States for the second consecutive quarter. The 2018 Q2 Upwork Skills Index also showed an increase in demand for individuals proficient in the programming languages and frameworks that are required to fill blockchain developer or engineer positions. Upwork: Blockchain the Fastest Growing Skill in US Freelance Job Market https://t.co/lCAj3jXzSx — CCN (@CryptoCoinsNews) August 4, 2018 Some of the programming languages required in the blockchain technology field include Go, Python, JavaScript and Java. The C++ programming language, which is the language employed in coding the most commonly used client of bitcoin, Bitcoin Core, is also considered fundamental. Solidity, a language created by the Ethereum project team specifically for writing smart contracts, is also required in the blockchain sector. Featured image from Shutterstock.\n",

      "A gang of Call of Duty players is suspected of masterminding a plan to steal more than $3 million in cryptocurrency. Citing unsealed court documents, the Chicago Sun-Times reports that the group — which includes a Dolton, IL man and a man from Bloomington, IL — is alleged to have hacked into cryptocurrency wallets after gaining access to the victims’ phones. ‘Forced to Cooperate’ According to an application for a warrant to search the Dolton man’s home, the Bloomington man informed the FBI that he met members of the group online while playing warfare simulation video game Call of Duty. He claimed that they forced him to partake by “SWATing” him– a slang that means raising a false alarm about a crime purportedly happening at a given address to trigger a response from law enforcement. He added that members of the group gave him details of victims to enable him to take over more than a hundred phones with the ultimate aim of stealing funds from the victims’ crypto wallets. The practice, known as “SIM hijacking” is becoming increasingly widespread as it is relatively low-tech with potentially high rewards if the stolen phone numbers are linked to crypto wallets. CCN recently reported that Bitcoin investor Michael Terpin sued AT&T for $224 million after losing $24 million worth of cryptocurrency to so-called SIM hijackers who managed to transfer his telephone number and subsequently reset the password to his crypto wallet. The FBI affidavit shows that San Francisco-based Augur reported on December 12, 2016, that their investors and employees were being targeted by cryptocurrency thieves. Augur’s protocol runs an online betting platform where a wide range of betting options exist using cryptocurrency. FBI Gets Involved Names of the suspects listed in the affidavit have not been mentioned and they have not been charged with any crimes yet. According to the FBI, the gang is suspected of stealing at least $3.3 million in various cryptocurrencies including about $805,000 worth of REP tokens by moving stolen tokens through cryptocurrency exchanges and mixers before sending them to their own wallets in the form of ether and bitcoin. Court records show that FBI agents were at the Dolton man’s home on August 1, seizing phones and computers. They interviewed the Bloomington suspect in March 2017. The affidavit contains transcripts of messages exchanged online between suspected ring members. The unnamed Bloomington man has told the Chicago Sun-Times in an online interview that he considers himself a victim in the matter. He claims to have never profited from crypto-hacking, stating that he has always cooperated with Augur and the FBI, and that the number of phones he helped to hack was substantially less than 100.

      "SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Blockchain technology startup Ripple Labs Inc confirmed to Reuters on Friday that it hired Amir Sarhangi, who had been leading Google’s rollout of a new wireless messaging system, as vice president of products. San Francisco-based Ripple, which is among the most well known startups trying to capitalize on the technology that underpins cryptocurrencies, said it was excited to have Sarhangi leading its effort to develop a global payments network known as RippleNet. Alphabet Inc’s Google did not respond to a request to comment on whether it had filled Sarhangi’s role as head of RCS, or rich communications services. Sarhangi joined Google through its acquisition in 2015 of Jibe Mobile, a startup he founded and led that developed technology for wireless carriers to adopt RCS. The standard is seen as a successor to SMS texting as it better handles sending multimedia and commercial messages, such as receipts and airline boarding passes, over cell networks. Google views those commercial applications as a potential revenue generator and has partnered with numerous device makers and wireless carriers to introduce RCS. But broad adoption has been stymied by leading device makers Apple Inc, which does not support RCS on iPhones, and Samsung Electronics Co, which in September announced limited support.\n",

      "A 23-year-old woman has been arrested by the Sydney police for stealing $65,000 worth cryptocurrencies from a 56-year-old man. Brisbane Times reported that the woman hacked the victim’s email account in January 2018. She used the two-step verification feature by changing the password and verifying it with her mobile number. She then sent 100,00 XRP to her account in China from the crypto accounts connected to the email account. The XRP were converted into Bitcoins and transferred to multiple e-wallets. The victim was able to acquire his account after two days, however, the woman had drained all his funds by that time. Arthur Katsogiannis, Cybercrime Squad commander, said, “It’s a very significant crime and it’s the first we know of its type in Australia where an individual has been arrested and charged for the technology-enabled theft of cryptocurrency.” Katsogiannis said that even though this crime is the first of its kind, it will become a norm in the coming years. He added that such incidents will prove to be dangerous for investors interested in cryptocurrencies. news.com.au reported that the Public Order and Riot Squad (PORS) caught the woman at her parent’s house in Ebbing and seized all of her electronic devices. The woman is set to appear at Burwood Local Court on November 19. Crypto Crimes Continue to Haunt Authorities Last month, Oklahoma police arrested two men for allegedly stealing $14 million worth CMCT tokens from blockchain-based IT company Crowd Machine. The men got hold of the victim’s SIM card and replaced it with a fake one to use the former to access the crypto wallet. In September 2018, Japanese crypto exchange Zaif lost 6.7 billion yen ($60 million) worth cryptocurrencies stored in hot wallets. This hack bore a resemblance to crypto exchange Coincheck’s hacking incident earlier this year. The exchange lost $530 million worth NEM stored in hot wallets, while the funds stored in cold wallets remained safe. Following the hack, the Financial Services Agency (FSA) of Japan sent business improvement orders to 6 crypto exchanges including Zaif. Japan’s National Police Agency (NPA) recently published a report which explained that 158 crypto crimes were reported in the first half of 2018 alone. The agency added that 60% of these cases occurred due to the use of similar account and password details in various online accounts. With a total of 60 billion yen (approximately $534 million) stolen this year, XRP and BTC are considered the most targeted cryptocurrencies. Featured image from Shutterstock.\n",

      "A gang of Call of Duty players is suspected of masterminding a plan to steal more than $3 million in cryptocurrency. Citing unsealed court documents, the Chicago Sun-Times reports that the group — which includes a Dolton, IL man and a man from Bloomington, IL — is alleged to have hacked into cryptocurrency wallets after gaining access to the victims’ phones. ‘Forced to Cooperate’ According to an application for a warrant to search the Dolton man’s home, the Bloomington man informed the FBI that he met members of the group online while playing warfare simulation video game Call of Duty. He claimed that they forced him to partake by “SWATing” him– a slang that means raising a false alarm about a crime purportedly happening at a given address to trigger a response from law enforcement. He added that members of the group gave him details of victims to enable him to take over more than a hundred phones with the ultimate aim of stealing funds from the victims’ crypto wallets. The practice, known as “SIM hijacking” is becoming increasingly widespread as it is relatively low-tech with potentially high rewards if the stolen phone numbers are linked to crypto wallets. CCN recently reported that Bitcoin investor Michael Terpin sued AT&T for $224 million after losing $24 million worth of cryptocurrency to so-called SIM hijackers who managed to transfer his telephone number and subsequently reset the password to his crypto wallet. The FBI affidavit shows that San Francisco-based Augur reported on December 12, 2016, that their investors and employees were being targeted by cryptocurrency thieves. Augur’s protocol runs an online betting platform where a wide range of betting options exist using cryptocurrency. FBI Gets Involved Names of the suspects listed in the affidavit have not been mentioned and they have not been charged with any crimes yet. According to the FBI, the gang is suspected of stealing at least $3.3 million in various cryptocurrencies including about $805,000 worth of REP tokens by moving stolen tokens through cryptocurrency exchanges and mixers before sending them to their own wallets in the form of ether and bitcoin. Court records show that FBI agents were at the Dolton man’s home on August 1, seizing phones and computers. They interviewed the Bloomington suspect in March 2017. The affidavit contains transcripts of messages exchanged online between suspected ring members. The unnamed Bloomington man has told the Chicago Sun-Times in an online interview that he considers himself a victim in the matter. He claims to have never profited from crypto-hacking, stating that he has always cooperated with Augur and the FBI, and that the number of phones he helped to hack was substantially less than 100.

      "The man who killed net neutrality in the US is racing-up with innovations like blockchain to effectively regulate them. Ajit Pai, the chairman of the US Federal Communications Commission (FCC), said that his office would be looking into the emerging technologies for their potential impact on the telecom sector. Naming artificial intelligence, machine learning, and quantum computing alongside blockchain, the 45-year old telecom regulator added that their regulatory frameworks would evolve according to the growth of the firms in these “dynamic industries.” “We don’t have jurisdiction over these firms, but that’s one of the things we are trying to learn about,” he explained. “What are the emerging technologies that will have an effect on this space and how should our thinking about regulation evolve.” Known for his role in repealing the net neutrality law enforced by Barack Obama’s government, Pai in internet pop culture became the nemesis of internet freedom. Not only his decision gave unruly powers to local internet providers, but it also threatened the citizens’ freedom of speech on the internet. Technologists also cornered Pai for his lack of understanding of the Bitcoin technology, after he wrongly named the digital currency for causing network delays on the internet. The law against Net Neutrality, in a real sense, has been considered as a threat to the cryptocurrency industry. The companies in the space could be forced to withstand corporate censorships, invoked by private deals with the ISPs. Pai’s comments on blockchain come at a time when regulators are going two-face on the technology’s prospects under a governed system. How Telecom Would Interact with Blockchain Pai’s role as the FCC chairman limits his jurisdiction to the telecom sector, mainly including interstate communications by radio, television, wire, satellite, cable – and now by the internet too. Considering blockchain’s dependence on the internet, it is likely that Pai and the public ledger technology would come face to face down the road. It is essential to understand that the US ISPs have a monopoly in the market. Over 51 percent of the Americans have one ISP to pick from, while the remaining 49 percent access the internet under the threat of throttling. The whole process is deeply anti-decentralized, which could hamper the growth of crypto sector as a whole. A financial giant in partnership with one of the ruling ISPs, for instance, could easily deprioritize a local fintech startup by limiting access to its services. These services could be anything from crypto-based remittance to blockchain-enabled recordkeeping solution. Justin Tabb, the CEO of Substratum Network, a decentralized internet startup, predicted these challenges for crypto companies. “ISPs could potentially have the power to control access to exchanges, the speed of transactions, and even create and prioritize accessibility to their cryptocurrencies, which is not such a crazy idea when you think of all the places in this country where a single ISP has a monopoly,” he told the International Business Times. Decentralization of ISPs Though, the challenges of Pai and the rest of the FCC could be more about blockchain’s potential to destabilize internet. The ledger, regardless of being in an infant stage, promises to decentralized anything that preaches monopoly – even ISPs. Theoretically, decentralization on the internet could be achieved by creating a mesh network where users can directly connect with each other. While a blockchain revolution for net neutrality still seems like a far-fetched sci-fi fantasy, the supporters could practice what’s available to them, i.e., democracy. Net neutrality is a wakeup call, and it is the job of the people to keep asking for laws that favor the growth of technologies like blockchain. Featured image from Flickr/Gage Skidmore.\n",

      "Unikrn, an esports company that raised over $15 million in its ICO pre-sale last year, has obtained a betting license in the Isle of Man, which is a key step on the way to rolling out its cryptocurrency betting service around the world. In October 2017, CCN reported that the startup raised $15 million from accredited investors including Mark Cuban, Ashton Kutcher, Elisabeth Murdoch, Guy O’Seary, Shari Redstone, Binary, Hyperspeed, Indicator Ventures, and Tabcorp, en route to a $32 million token sale, according to TokenData. When the platform launches, users will be able to place bets on esports events, teams, and players. They will also be able to bet on their own performance in popular esports games like Fortnite, League of Legends and Dota 2. Unikoin Gold and Unikrn Jet Using infrastructure provided by Bittrex, users will be given the ability to seamlessly take part in betting and gaming activities using cryptocurrencies on the platform. Unikrn’s native cryptocurrency, UnikoinGold (UKG) will be deployed on the platform to give users access to exclusive benefits, as it seeks to become recognised as the default esports wagering token in more than 20 countries including 80 percent of Europe and parts of Asia and Latin America. Speaking about the user experience on Unikrn, Andrew Vouris, the firm’s COO, said: “This is long in the making. You can bet in fiat, crypto, or both, to bet on live markets or pre match for twenty titles and dozens of games a day on titles such as League of Legends, Dota and Fortnite.” According to information released by the company, Unikrn has developed a fully functional wagering backend called Unikrn Jet, which is built on blockchain technology and can process over 9,000 bets per second. Unikrn Jet is already live for the platform’s play token economy and is ready for immediate deployment for regulated crypto and fiat betting. Speaking about Unikrn Jet and Unikrn’s Isle of Man license, Unikrn co-founder and CEO Rahul Sood said: “Unikrn built the most advanced wagering backend in the world, built by incorporating blockchain technologies, and we’re entering a segment of the global games market which exceeds $30 billion. Equally historic for esports, wagering and blockchain, we’re the first company on the planet to launch with a license including crypto and fiat betting from the Isle of Man, which is home to one of the most respected regulators for gambling.” According to the company, live betting for esports and gaming competitions on the platform will be launched in October for both fiat and crypto customers. Using the transaction engine provided by Bittrex, users will also have a frictionless transaction experience when converting their fiat or crypto to UKG. Featured image from Flickr/JD Lasica\n",

      "For several decades, banks and financial advisors have searched for ways to get those without vast resources to invest and save their money. An early example was Bank of America’s Keep the Change program, which rounded up purchases and moved the change to savings accounts. The Need for Passive Investment A few years back, the Lawnmower app came to fruition, enabling users to do a similar thing, except their spare change went to buy a small amount of Bitcoin. It later expanded to allow for numerous blockchain assets, though it is no longer available. In the traditional investing space, the Acorns app is all the rage, enabling users to do the same thing with the traditional stock market. Everyday Americans have been increasingly interested in venture capitalism since the dawn of the dotcom boom, and CNBC’s Shark Tank, now in its tenth season, while a poor example of how VC meetings go, has the popularity to demonstrate this fact. Occasionally, technological innovations cross the stage of Shark Tank, and this week’s episode featured a creation of interest to crypto enthusiasts: the Bundil app, a Lawnmower-style application that enables users to invest their spare change in cryptocurrency. Passive investment options like Bundil and Acorns are an important part of the 21st-century financial landscape. In the past, the best an everyday person could do was hire someone they hoped could manage their money successfully. Too many examples of fraud and theft took place in that era to list. Whenever you put a great deal of value in a centralized location and give one person or a small group of people in full control of it, bad things can and will happen. The era of the blockchain makes such instances rarer. Kevin O’Leary Goes in for $100K Of Shark Tank’s investor lineup, Mark Cuban is the most likely to invest in blockchain technologies. However, already having money in several including the untraceable messaging platform Dust and being an advisor on the Mercury protocol, he said he’s already invested in a similar platform to Bundil and passed on the offer. Perhaps the heel of the show, Kevin O’Leary is often mocked by his fellow Shark Tank investors and rarely actually strikes a deal on the show. Being that all the other sharks backed out, O’Leary was Bundil creator Dmitri Love’s last hope. Love was offering a 10% stake in his company for $100,000, thereby valuing the application at $1 million. O’Leary asked a surprising question for a balding millionaire investor: “Which cryptos does it support?” Love responded that it supports Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Ethereum. O’Leary was no nicer to Love than he is to anyone, and demanded 50% of the company in exchange for $100,000, effectively devaluing the company by 80%. He said, “You are going to fail within 36 months.” Matt Higgins suggested that Love should partner with existing exchanges to expand his reach, and Cuban notably said this was a good way to kill the business while trying to grow it. Higgins said that competing products were too easy to build. After all the other sharks had backed out, O’Leary reiterated that he would be a 50/50 partner at $100,000, or he would also back out. Love seemed displeased with the offer, noting that “50% is a lot,” but ultimately accepted the investment from Kevin O’Leary. This effectively means that Bundil now has the star power and reach of a famous investor. Love created Bundil as an answer to friends and family who continually pestered him about the perils of investing in cryptocurrency. It’s hard to convince people that they should risk real money on something they hardly understand. Acquiring Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies comes with its own set of hurdles, so by the time an only-casually-interested party gets to where they can actually buy some coin, they’ve probably lost interest. In this way, passive investment apps are extremely important for the viability of cryptocurrency as a whole. Love told the sharks: “I thought, ‘Man, you know, anyone that’s trying to invest in cryptocurrency has to go through all these steps to try to figure out how to buy it. And I thought there could be an easier way for it to be done.” Bundil costs $3 per month or $24 per year. It connects to your chosen payment method and slowly grows your Bitcoin balance. For those cautious or cash-strapped, it and other similar methods are potentially the only realistic way to introduce themselves to the important new world that is cryptocurrency.

      "Throughout the past ten days, the Bitcoin price has remained in a tight range from $6,300 to $6,500, rarely initiating a noticeable movement. The 1-day price chart of Bitcoin, as shown below, demonstrates nearly two weeks of stability in the lower price range of the dominant cryptocurrency, unable to engage in a short-term upside movement to confirm a breakout above a major resistance level. In the past 24 hours, the volume of BTC has fallen back to $3.1 billion from $3.5 billion, by more than 10 percent. The lack of trading activity in the cryptocurrency exchange market can be attributed to the tendency of traders to prevent the initiation of high-risk and high-return trades in a period of extended stability and low volatility. Breakout Expected According to prominent cryptocurrency trader and technical analyst Peter Brandt, the price trend of BTC throughout the past ten days demonstrates a classic Wyckoff hinge, which suggests that buyers are in control in the market that has been dominated by bears and sellers since early 2018. “Wyckoff would classify these past 10 days as classic hinge behavior,” Brandt said. However, for the hinge to materialize, an abrupt increase in the price of Bitcoin to the $6,800 to $7,000 range to breakout of the $6,800 resistance level is required, which traders are observing at this time. Due to the low volume and trading activity of the cryptocurrency exchange market, a sudden breakout of Bitcoin in a higher price range is becoming increasingly unlikely, at least in the short-term. As for technical indicators and minor price movements of Bitcoin, since August 9, the asset has barely made any movement outside of the $6,300 to $6,800 range, portraying the lowest rate of volatility in recent years. Often, the stability in the price of BTC leads to an increase in value of small market cap cryptocurrencies and tokens. But, the low volume of the crypto market has prevented traders from engaging in risky trades in a market that is highly unpredictable. Most tokens including Wanchain, Golem, Funfair, Aelf, and Zilliqa have made 2 to 8 percent gains across the board over the last 24 hours. Positive Development Out of China Throughout the past several months, with the imposition of a ban on Alipay in settling cryptocurrency-related transactions, the government of China has cracked down on the crypto market, strengthening the existing blanket ban on the asset class. On October 26, CnLedger, a trusted cryptocurrency source in China, reported that a local court ruled Bitcoin to be a property and protected under law, reaffirming the legality of owning and holding BTC. “Chinese court confirms Bitcoin is protected by law. Shenzhen Court of International Arbitration ruled a case involving cryptos. Inside the verdict: China law does not forbid owning & transferring bitcoin, which should be protected by law because of its property nature and economic value.” While the ruling of the court does not change the inability of investors in China to legally invest in BTC, it is possible to rely on over-the-counter (OTC) markets to purchase crypto and hold onto them.

      "The fast-growing blockchain technology sector has created a high demand for talent and this has consequently resulted in blockchain engineers being among the best-remunerated in the tech sector. According to CNBC, the average pay for blockchain engineers in the United States is between US$150,000 and US$175,000 making it comparable to what developers who specialize in another high-demand field, artificial intelligence, make. The two fields now currently offer the highest-earning specialized engineering roles. Typical software engineers make an average of US$135,000. Surge in Openings This comes at a time when the job postings requiring blockchain technology skills have increased dramatically. For instance, Hired, a San Francisco, California-based tech sector recruitment firm which provided CNBC with the salary stats in the tech sector, has seen a 400% increase in the job postings seeking employees with blockchain technology skills since late last year. “There’s a ton of demand for blockchain. Software engineers are in very short supply, but this is even more acute and that’s why salaries are even higher,” Hired’s CEO, Mehul Patel, told the business news TV channel. This is similar to a finding by jobs site Glassdoor which saw job listings related to blockchain and cryptocurrencies increase by 300% in August 2018 compared to the same period last year. In the United States, most of the blockchain-related jobs are located in New York City (24%) and San Francisco (21%). Outside the United States the top-five cities with the highest number of blockchain-related job openings were London (16%), Singapore (7%), Toronto (7%), Hong Kong (6%) and Berlin (4%). Top Destinations for Blockchain Talent Per Glassdoor, some of the top-hirers are startups such as Circle, Kraken, Figure, Coinbase and ConsenSys though established firms such as Oracle, IBM, KPMG and Accenture also feature in the top ten. The findings by Hired and Glassdoor also echo a similar conclusion drawn by leading freelance jobs website Upwork. As CCN reported two months ago, blockchain was the fastest growing freelance skill on the telecommuting platform in the United States for the second consecutive quarter. The 2018 Q2 Upwork Skills Index also showed an increase in demand for individuals proficient in the programming languages and frameworks that are required to fill blockchain developer or engineer positions. Upwork: Blockchain the Fastest Growing Skill in US Freelance Job Market https://t.co/lCAj3jXzSx — CCN (@CryptoCoinsNews) August 4, 2018 Some of the programming languages required in the blockchain technology field include Go, Python, JavaScript and Java. The C++ programming language, which is the language employed in coding the most commonly used client of bitcoin, Bitcoin Core, is also considered fundamental. Solidity, a language created by the Ethereum project team specifically for writing smart contracts, is also required in the blockchain sector. Featured image from Shutterstock.\n",

      "Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange, has voluntarily engaged in an initiative to eliminate money laundering on its platform. For years, despite the inherent lack of privacy measures on major public blockchain networks like Bitcoin and Ethereum that discourage the settlement of illicit transactions, a widely pushed narrative against crypto has been the suspected usage of digital assets by criminals. Eliminating Easily Refutable Claims Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, Bitcoin Cash, EOS, and many other major cryptocurrencies are not anonymous by nature. With Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) systems integrated by cryptocurrency exchanges, it is extremely difficult for criminals to utilize digital assets to settle the transfer of illegal proceeds. Authorities and government agencies across the globe are well aware of the non-anonymous characteristic of blockchains, which could have motivated governments like the US, Japan, and South Korea to legitimate and recognize the cryptocurrency market. This week, Binance has started to cooperate with Chainalysis, a leading blockchain analysis company that evaluates suspicious transactions and addresses, to improve its AML system and to further legitimize the cryptocurrency sector. “Cryptocurrency businesses of all sizes face the same core challenge: earning the trust of regulators, financial institutions and users. We expect many to follow Binance’s lead to build world-class AML compliance programs to satisfy regulators globally and build trust with major financial institutions,” said Jonathan Levin, co-founder and COO of Chainalysis. In 2018, some of the world’s most influential banks were cracked down for money laundering. Danske Bank laundered $243 billion from criminal groups, and as CCN reported on October 20, Nordea Bank, the largest financial group in the Nordic countries, is said to have taken several illicit payments from banks in the Baltic region. With the institutional market of cryptocurrencies growing exponentially, the tightening of AML systems employed by public exchanges is expected to solidify cryptocurrencies as a recognized asset class and the digital asset market as a well-regulated sector. Wei Zhao, the CFO at Binance, said that maintaining the firm’s vision of increasing the freedom of money globally, the exchange will continue to adhere to regulatory mandates in the countries it operates in. “By working with Chainalysis, we are able to continue building a foundational compliance program that enables the next phase of our growth. Our vision is to provide the infrastructure for a blockchain ecosystem and increase the freedom of money globally, while adhering to regulatory mandates in the countries we serve.” Importance of Compliance The cryptocurrency sector is entering a new phase of development and growth, as Zhou explained. During the 2017 bull market in which the valuation of the cryptocurrency market surged to $800 billion, the asset class obtained significant mainstream awareness in both countries that support crypto and regions that have established impractical regulatory frameworks to prevent local blockchain markets to flourish. In a period in which governments are introducing increasing efforts to embrace crypto and blockchain businesses as a part of the fourth industrial revolution, voluntary initiatives by companies like Binance to legitimize the industry will ease the process of governments in regulating and acknowledging the global market.

CCN does not endorse, nor is responsible for any material included below and isn’t responsible for any damages or losses connected with any products or services mentioned in the press release. CCN urges readers to conduct their own research with due diligence into the company, product or service mentioned in the press release. In the 90’s when the internet was gradually gaining mass adoption, it was accompanied by mass education. The more information you have about something, the more inclined you are to use it. Blockchain enthusiasts tell anyone who cares to listen that the current development of this novel technology is parallel to the days of the internet. This is why it is termed the fourth revolution. A large chunk of adoption activities have been taking place in Western countries, only recently has the tide shifted to Africa. Before now, speculation over the volatile price of cryptocurrencies was the order of the day, with few if any, aware of the inherent potentials in blockchain, the underlying technology. For adoption to accelerate, education has to trump speculation. Moreover, before innovation of any magnitude can happen, there has to be some form of education. Speed, transparency, security, decentralization, ease of access, are just some of the features of blockchain that makes it suitable for addressing Africa’s myriad of economic and industrial development issues. Daily, indigenous blockchain startups are coming up with actual use cases that would help solve local problems. As part of the KuBitX ecosystem, blockchain can help Africa solve the problem of high transaction fees and speed of transaction when it comes to remittances. If blockchain is used to digitize the land registry, cases of land fraud would become extinct. Running financial activities of the economy on the blockchain can help check corruption in both the public and private sector, not to mention boosting of cross-border e-commerce through crypto payments. In this vein, there has been a surge in education focused events happening around the continent. At least weekly, one hears about a conference, seminar or workshop geared towards mass education of all things blockchain and crypto. Mass adoption through mass education is one of the foundational goals of KuBitX, a global exchange founded with the vision of helping Africa position herself for a financially secure future, using blockchain. To facilitate this, KuBitX has a system of Global Channel Ambassadors, charged with the duty of disseminating blockchain and crypto education to the grassroots. To that market woman, to that cobbler down the road, the unbanked, the underrepresented, the ones who are originally meant to be the beneficiaries of Satoshi’s vision. Other than intimating the masses with the near unlimited potentials of blockchain, KuBitX intends to intensify educational activities on training blockchain developers, and thus curb another century of brain drain. Demand for blockchain related skills worldwide surpasses available options. With properly structured education and mentorship programs in Africa, indigenously trained blockchain professionals could bridge this gap in the nearest future. On the regulation side, just Kenya and South Africa seem to have a definite framework in place. Most African countries are adopting a cautious approach by not outrightly banning cryptocurrencies or blockchain, but issuing warnings to businesses and individuals dealing with cryptocurrencies. Understandably, the negative reputation of cryptocurrency has spilled over into blockchain. This is where proper education is essential so that our regulatory authorities are better informed when taking their stance on blockchain and crypto. Some countries like Kenya and Mauritius are positively embracing the technology by setting up sandboxes and working committees or task force.\n",

      "Its an important day for HTC. The companys Android smartphones, once touted as among the best around (theyre still pretty good), havent been selling very well in recent years. But HTC is reinventing itself with a new device, that fully jumps onto the hottest trend in technology: the blockchain. Starting today, HTC is accepting pre-orders for the Exodus 1, an \"early access\" version of the previously announced Exodus device. In smartphone terms, the Exodus 1 a pretty powerful phone, in line with the top flagships of today. Its got a 6-inch Quad HD display with 18:9 aspect ratio, a dual, 16-megapixel back camera and a dual, 8-megapixel selfie camera. Its powered by a Snapdragon 845 processor, and its got 6GB of RAM, 128GB of storage, a 3,500mAh battery and IP68 dust/waterproof rating. Its only weak point, specs-wise, is the fact that its running Android Oreo and not Android Pie. We dont know much about the design, beyond the render (below) which indicates that the phone might have a see-through back, similar to the design of the HTC U12+. Image: HTC More interesting than the specs are the phones blockchain-related capabilities. First, it comes with a \"secure enclave,\" which HTC describes as a \"locked area on the device that is protected from the Android OS.\" This is where you hold your cryptocurrency private keys; ideally, even if your phones security gets compromised in some ways, the private keys in the secure enclave should remain safe. HTCs Decentralized Chief Officer (yes, thats a real title), Phil Chen, told me via e-mail that the secure enclave is not a separate chip. Instead, its utilizing ARMs TrustZone tech, which is typically used for payment, authentication and content protection. This is \"the first time anyone has given access to the TrustZone to the people,\" Chen told me. The phone also has an interesting way of retrieving your private keys even if your phone is lost in stolen. It involves picking a few trustworthy contacts, each of whom must download an app. Then, your private keys seed is split using a secret sharing algorithm (based on a well-known cryptography concept called Shamirs Secret Sharing, Chen confirmed to me), with each part sent to your contacts. None of them can retrieve the key on their own, but you can retrieve the key by combining all the parts. Another advantage of this approach is that your key is sort of in the cloud, but its not stored in any central location and certainly not on HTCs servers. HTC will release APIs for third party developers to create apps that work with the Exodus 1 hardware. The phone will also come with pre-installed, blockchain-related apps, but Chen says the specifics of that will be revealed at a later stage. Ive asked Chen about the \"Exodus 1\" moniker, and the companys \"early access\" language, which makes the device sound like an early version of something. \"This is a 1.0 version,\" Chen told me. \"The problem we’re solving is obviously very complicated and there’s a reason no one has managed to do it yet. Namely, giving tools to the people to own their own keys and also when they lose they their phone, the ability to recover it. We need the help of the community to harden our wallet and make it more secure. The crypto internet is still in its infant stages, the Exodus is the first attempt to lay the foundation for that internet. And the first step is to empower and educate the consumer to own their own keys.\" he said. As for the companys original announcement that each Exodus phone will allow users to run a cryptocurrency node, Chen also says this will be added in a \"later stage.\" The HTC Exodus 1 can be pre-ordered at www.htcexodus.com in 34 countries, including the U.S., Taiwan, HK, Singapore, New Zealand, UK, Austria, Norway and \"other European countries.\" It ships in December. In true blockchain style, HTC is pricing the phone in Ethereum and Bitcoin. You will be able to buy it with those two coins, at a price of 0.15 BTC or 4.78 ETH. Thats roughly $960 at the time of writing, but given cryptos volatility, it might be a considerably different number at publish time.

      "The UK government has blocked a Royal Mint plan to create a “digital gold” token that would trade on a cryptocurrency exchange. According to sources cited in Reuters, the British finance ministry refused to approve the 1,100-year old Mint’s plans to issue as much as $1 billion worth of “Royal Mint Gold” (RMG) tokens, which would have been backed by gold assets stored in the government-owned Mint’s vaults. “Sadly, due to market conditions this did not prove possible at this time, but we will revisit this if and when market conditions are right,” a Mint spokesperson was cited as saying. Initially, The Royal Mint had planned to list the tokens on a blockchain-based exchange operated by U.S. derivatives exchange CME, which also manages the largest regulated bitcoin futures market. However, the CME backed out of the partnership just prior to the scheduled launch date late last year, delaying the project and forcing the Mint to pursue a cryptocurrency exchange listing to save the venture. That was a bridge too far for the finance ministry, who considered such a partnership too risky for the Mint, and, by extension, the government. Without approval to move forward with the project, Mint CEO Anne Jessop — who was appointed in Feb. 2018 — shut the project down, leading to four employees being laid off and another 7-8 “made redundant.” Had the full $1 billion in RMG been issued on a public blockchain, the token would have been numbered among the world’s most valuable cryptocurrencies. At current valuations, it would have ranked just outside the top 15 largest cryptoassets, trailing closely behind NEO and ethereum classic (ETC). The sources cited in the report suggested that CME, which launched bitcoin futures in Dec. 2017 and has seen minor-but-growing volumes in this market, may be “cooling” toward this nascent asset class. “CME’s management changed, and they walked away, didn’t want to get involved,” one source told the publication. CME, on its part, told Reuters that it was “continuing to assess client demand with our partner and have nothing new to report at this time.” CCN had first reported the Royal Mint’s plans to create a blockchain asset back in 2016.

      "Jakarta, Indonesia, Oct. 23, 2018: Noorcoin launched its application demo for 57 Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) member countries in the annual session of the Islamic Chamber of Commerce, Industry & Agriculture (ICCIA) of the OIC on October 22-23 2018 in Jakarta. OIC is the second largest inter-governmental organization after the United Nations. The meeting is attended by the delegation from 57 OIC member countries. Noorcoin Founder and CEO, Sofia Koswara said, “OIC member countries, such as Brunei and Kingdom of Saudi Arabia as the guardian of two most holy cities with pilgrims from all over the world, was very serious about using Noorcoin. Banks in Saudi Arabia to the Zakat Council in the country began to think about the use of digital money as an alternative to long-term financial transactions. We believe once the application demo is completed, Noorcoin will reach acceleration in a few months.” Noorcoin COO, Thomas Yudhistira said, “The purpose of the application demo is not only to test the technological issue, but also the cultural and legal environment in each 57 OIC member countries. For example, there is a widespread misconception towards cryptocurrency in the Middle East due to the notion that it is against Sharia law. Muhammad Abu Bakar (certified Muslim legal expert) in a report says that cryptocurrencies are permissible under Sharia law. Noorcoin is developed with sharia compliance in mind so we are positive that we would be compliant to national sharia regulations, which to be proven with this testnet.” Noorcoin CBDO, Iskandar Purnomohadi said, “The application demo was run using Ethereum Virtual Server and Ethereum Ropsten Testnet before full implementation and transition on Zilliqa blockchain platform around Q1 2019. This is to show Noorcoin’s mobile application demo’s potential and usability for the Muslim community. Also in a later stage after ICO, Noorcoin also plans to back its cryptocurrency with gold, to increase stability and security for its holders.” As part of the launching, Noorcoin was awarded by World Achievement Institute (LEPRID) as the First Shariah Token in the World with its Advanced Technology. World Achievement Institute’s Director and Founder, Paulus Pangka said, “Technology innovation which has a mass positive impact to billion population need to be recognized and supported. Noorcoin shariah token is really the trailblazer, eligible for a world record” Ambassador of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to Indonesia HE Osamh Mohammed Abdullah Shuibi who attend the launch to represent the country to accept Noorcoin D-app demo testnet said, “The use of digital money in Islamic countries is very important. In addition to facilitating transactions, the main objective is to reduce the dominance of the US dollar. Noorcoin, the first digital Islamic money, can be used for Umrah and Hajj services, as well as inter-state transactions. There are three advantages that Noorcoin has, namely transparent, safe and low cost. At present some countries are experiencing a weakening of the currency against the US dollar. We must have an alternative.” Previously, Indonesia Presidential Chief of Staff, General (Retd.) Moeldoko, as reported in the media, saw positively on the Noorcoin proposal. According to him, the unity of Islamic countries joined in the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) in the field of economics and trade must continue to be improved. Therefore, the momentum of ICCIA OIC can be a unifying force. ABOUT NOORCOIN: Noorcoin is the First Sharia Token in the world, building award winning sharia-compliant crypto-token and platform, decentralized trust and reputation system working flawlessly together through a blockchain based on-chain real-time payment gateway. We are creating a shariah-compliant, decentralized payment and trust solution on the Zilliqa blockchain leveraging smart contract technology.

CCN does not endorse, nor is responsible for any material included below and isn’t responsible for any damages or losses connected with any products or services mentioned in the press release. CCN urges readers to conduct their own research with due diligence into the company, product or service mentioned in the press release. Available now on Android and iOS, the free app offers cryptocurrency holders a better user experience, with virtual financial asset banking, transfer, investment, and more. QORMI, MALTA (Oct. 15, 2018) — Noomi Wallet, a brand new, cryptocurrency banking application developed by a dedicated team of blockchain experts, officially launched today for Android and iOS devices. The digital wallet, which aims to make cryptocurrency in everyday life a mainstream reality, is designed to be both practical and easy to use. Serious crypto investors now have a place they can invest their virtual financial assets, or VFAs, in high-yield Bitcoin and Ethereum accounts. And thanks to the streamlined user interface, it’s the perfect app for crypto fans to introduce their family, friends, and associates — i.e. those who may not be as familiar with or comfortable using crypto — to the emerging world of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other VFAs. Among the core features: Invest and grow your VFAs — Open a Bitcoin or Ethereum investment account with fixed, guaranteed APRs. Support for all your VFAs — Noomi already supports some of the world’s most popular cryptocurrencies, which you can store safely in this easy-to-use wallet. These include Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH) and ERC20 tokens, CyberMiles Token (CMT), and more to come. Instant and free transfers and withdrawals — Instantly transfer VFAs to your friends on Noomi for free. W allet staking (coming soon) — Noomi is the first—and only—way for people who don’t have CMT cubes to participate still in block rewards and staking. These features offer immediate value to users and are the first part of an overall vision of building a compelling VFA services solution for the blockchain ecosystem: “Cryptocurrency is giving rise to new ways of interacting with money and commerce,” Andrew Dao, CEO of Noomi said. “There are countless promising new blockchains and tokens being launched that strive to innovate entire industries, unlock new value for users, and create something better and unique. We believe the innovation and creativity of this blockchain-based ecosystem will evolve the way business, commerce, and finance is done, a change that cannot happen overnight.” In addition to its primary VFA banking and payment transfer functions, Noomi sets itself further apart from other crypto wallets on the market by: Empowering users to invest their BTC and ETH like fiat. Noomi works with VFA managers to let users deposit VFAs into investment accounts, with guaranteed returns, great rates (6-10 percent p.a.), and short investment periods (14-30 days). Enabling usernames that you can remember. In addition to a standard wallet address, all Noomi users can choose a unique username for themselves and share that name with other users so that they can send or request cryptocurrency from you instantly. Erasing gas fees. Within the Noomi network, users can send cryptocurrency to each other instantly and for free. When sending outside the Noomi network, Noomi will pay the gas fee* for the supported VFAs. Eliminating the need to have a separate wallet app for different cryptocurrencies. Store and manage all of them in the Noomi Wallet, it’s as simple as that. Furthermore, Noomi’s team is in the process of applying for the Malta government-issued license to store, transfer and manage VFAs, making it one of the first crypto wallets in the world in full compliance with Malta VFA laws and regulations. “Our goal for Noomi is not only to support a new blockchain ecosystem, but also to assist the transition from traditional to blockchain-based practices by providing the critical layers of banking, payment processing, and investment services that tie it all together,” Dao said. “Moreover, we’re doing it in a way that benefits the people and businesses who are pioneers in this change. This app of ours is the first step.” Noomi has partnered with CyberMiles, a new public blockchain for e-commerce, as part of the CyberMiles ecosystem. Noomi is one of more than two dozen “Supernode” candidates for the CyberMiles’ blockchain, which is set for release this week. This strategic move is intended to position Noomi as not only a leader in the VFA services space but also a critical link in the DPoS consensus protocol that will power the CyberMiles network. “Till now, blockchain technology has been geared largely toward technical advancements or improvements like public ledgers and smart contracts,” Dr. Lucas Lu, founder, and CEO of the CyberMiles Foundation said. “While more and more people hear about cryptocurrency every day, few of us actually own it. Its potential to revolutionize how we pay, share information, and even how we interact with each other is yet to be realized. Expanding our ecosystem, we’re confident about paving the way for regular consumers to experience the benefits of cryptocurrency like never before.” Noomi already has undergone a professional security audit to ensure the safety of the VFAs held by the wallet and the users’ personal information. To learn more about the Noomi Wallet, go to noomiwallet.com, or join Noomi’s Telegram community at t.me/noomiofficial. *For a limited time only, Noomi is offering zero gas fees on any ERC20 token transaction from a Noomi user to a non-Noomi user. While CMT will be included as well, ETH and BTC transactions do not qualify for this promotional period. About Noomi Wallet Noomi was created to make virtual financial asset management and investment easy, secure, and most importantly, profitable. Our team of blockchain experts have banded together to build the best-in-class virtual financial asset investment and management platform that combines the traditional wallet with investment features to help you earn more no matter how the market is performing. Building on our team’s experience partnering with successful blockchain projects, we are offering an innovative new way for users to manage their virtual financial assets.

      "Unikrn, an esports company that raised over $15 million in its ICO pre-sale last year, has obtained a betting license in the Isle of Man, which is a key step on the way to rolling out its cryptocurrency betting service around the world. In October 2017, CCN reported that the startup raised $15 million from accredited investors including Mark Cuban, Ashton Kutcher, Elisabeth Murdoch, Guy O’Seary, Shari Redstone, Binary, Hyperspeed, Indicator Ventures, and Tabcorp, en route to a $32 million token sale, according to TokenData. When the platform launches, users will be able to place bets on esports events, teams, and players. They will also be able to bet on their own performance in popular esports games like Fortnite, League of Legends and Dota 2. Unikoin Gold and Unikrn Jet Using infrastructure provided by Bittrex, users will be given the ability to seamlessly take part in betting and gaming activities using cryptocurrencies on the platform. Unikrn’s native cryptocurrency, UnikoinGold (UKG) will be deployed on the platform to give users access to exclusive benefits, as it seeks to become recognised as the default esports wagering token in more than 20 countries including 80 percent of Europe and parts of Asia and Latin America. Speaking about the user experience on Unikrn, Andrew Vouris, the firm’s COO, said: “This is long in the making. You can bet in fiat, crypto, or both, to bet on live markets or pre match for twenty titles and dozens of games a day on titles such as League of Legends, Dota and Fortnite.” According to information released by the company, Unikrn has developed a fully functional wagering backend called Unikrn Jet, which is built on blockchain technology and can process over 9,000 bets per second. Unikrn Jet is already live for the platform’s play token economy and is ready for immediate deployment for regulated crypto and fiat betting. Speaking about Unikrn Jet and Unikrn’s Isle of Man license, Unikrn co-founder and CEO Rahul Sood said: “Unikrn built the most advanced wagering backend in the world, built by incorporating blockchain technologies, and we’re entering a segment of the global games market which exceeds $30 billion. Equally historic for esports, wagering and blockchain, we’re the first company on the planet to launch with a license including crypto and fiat betting from the Isle of Man, which is home to one of the most respected regulators for gambling.” According to the company, live betting for esports and gaming competitions on the platform will be launched in October for both fiat and crypto customers. Using the transaction engine provided by Bittrex, users will also have a frictionless transaction experience when converting their fiat or crypto to UKG. Featured image from Flickr/JD Lasica\n",

      "Three university scholars – two from the University of Florida and one from Princeton – have concluded what many veteran cryptocurrency enthusiasts have long known and loudly preached: pump-and-dump schemes are bad. In a new paper currently in progress by Tao Li, Donghwa Shin, and Baolian Wang, the scholars provide evidence that market manipulation schemes “are detrimental to the liquidity and price of cryptocurrencies.” CCN readers may have an interest in the context of the paper in relation to the recent activity at YoBit, in which the exchange itself openly promised to inject a ton of money into random coins in order to inflate their price. What Is A Pump-And-Dump Scheme? For the uninitiated, the term “pump-and-dump” might be foreign. Therefore we should first point out that these schemes did not begin with cryptocurrency and they will be around forever. That’s right: there is no eliminating the pump and dump scheme so long as people are free to make trading decisions on their own. In any case, a “pump” is when a great deal of value is injected into a given stock, symbol, or, in our case, cryptocurrency, in a market sense. A hype cycle is often involved, and new products are especially likely to be P&Ds. A lone investor with a lot of capital or a small group of colluding entities can make a huge difference in weak markets. The examples in the cryptosphere are endless. One or two bitcoins can purchase a large amount of literally thousands of different coins, and if there are only a few exchanges listing a given token, the “price” will see a significant rise. The “dump” part of the scheme is when the people acquiring the asset and necessarily driving its price to ridiculous highs sell off their stake to people who are none the wiser. The people buying at rates which previously would have been unreasonable believe they are buying long-term, solid assets. There is also a psychological element to both gambling and investing in which a dominant part of the human brain believes that things will be the way they are today tomorrow. The reality is that pump and dump schemes are hard to regulate without hard facts and informants because often enough, on the surface, they can appear like healthy boom-time trading. High-risk instruments trading has one goal: get out at the top, or nearest to the top that you can. Experienced traders understand that any asset can turn to absolute crap overnight. Traditional stocks can dive on the news cycle. The fundamentals are what matter. But with even more high-risk instruments, such as speculative technologies and the tokens that power them, the fundamentals are incredibly difficult to gauge. This reporter has dedicated a substantial portion of his life to covering the happenings around cryptocurrencies, tokens, and the like, and still he is overly cautious in most investments surrounding them due to the simple fact that the future is unwritten, and something entirely unexpected can overshadow the basket you dump all your eggs into. All of which is to say: trading amidst a pump and dump conspiracy is like being caught in a building victimized by arson. The arsonist is most likely to get out with barely even any smoke in his lungs, if he gets burned at all. The rest of the people suffer by degrees. The last person to sell loses the most money. Hype Is Important The hype cycle is important to most of these schemes, but it is not absolutely necessary for success. A pump-and-dump expert could potentially fool a market mostly made up of trading robots. Inside information such as the said bots’ trading triggers would help a great deal. A pump-and-dump scheme can go for weeks or months, or it can last a few days. Often, hundreds of smaller traders participate in private Telegram groups with the intent of making each other richer. As the scholars write: In the cryptocurrency market, manipulators often organize “pump groups” using encrypted messaging apps such as Telegram. They create Telegram channels and invite other investors to join. They frequently advertise on social media platforms to attract investors. A Telegram channel operator can post messages for other members to read. For a planned pump, the operator announces the target date, time, and exchange, usually at least one day in advance. However, they do not disclose the identity of the target token until the scheduled time. Members also receive multiple reminder messages before the announcement of the token symbol. As we show in this paper, a typical cryptocurrency P&D lasts for only several minutes. Therefore, it is reasonable to believe that Telegram channel members are important participants in P&Ds. What it really boils down to is having enough money and the know-how to raise the price of a given asset. We don’t use the word “value” because the actual value of a token is relative to much more than what people on markets are trading it for that day. As an example, if Bitcoin dove 75% again tomorrow, its actual “value” would probably not be reflected in the market price. Likely as not, it would cost more to mine it, for a time, than it would to buy it. But the value of Bitcoin is much more than what people are willing to pay for it at a given second. The price is a separate thing. The most successful schemes happen at the launch of a token or a coin and are perpetuated by the creators or “team” themselves. Entire blockchains have been created and abandoned in the pursuit of sometimes small amounts of Bitcoin. What Can Be Done? As earlier stated, pump and dump fraud is like any other unsavory activity: it will always be there. How much and how often it is allowed to affect the rest of society is where positive action is possible. The study done by the authors reviewed a specific case, Bittrex, and its tactics attempting to mitigate or eliminate pumping and dumping on its platform. The results were apparently positive in nature: Messages about pump groups on Telegram show that traders involved in P&D tactics had taken notice of the warning. Many scheduled P&D events were immediately canceled. For example, one prominent pump channel, “Trading signals for crypto,” canceled its P&D event on November 26, 2017. Some message groups solicited feedback from group members regarding whether to switch to other exchanges. Many message groups eventually ceased to pump tokens traded on Bittrex and/or switched to alternative exchanges such as Yobit. Another conclusion of the paper is that newcomers are often looted of their initial investment. Again, in so many ways crypto trading parallels gambling: a new poker player might be bullied off his small stake by insane bets on the part of a bluffing veteran, or simply not know what they are doing and lose their money that way. The major difference is that a gambler understands it’s a just a game, whereas most investors are earnestly trying to make money, and often they are influenced by false information or downright lies. Resultantly, there is and may for the foreseeable future be “significant wealth transfer” from newcomers to immoral scam artists masquerading as investors. And as long as there is a market for something, there will be a provider. We can’t stress enough how absurd it is for an exchange itself to openly “pump” coins at random, as Yobit have done. The next step is the exchange operators simply running off with the money, which has happened before. Perhaps it’s better than exchanges which do it on the sly, as most every exchange has been excused. Yet, there was long speculation that Crytpsy was pumping the price of Paycoin and other tokens using customer funds, and look what happened there. Featured image from Shutterstock.\n",

      "For several decades, banks and financial advisors have searched for ways to get those without vast resources to invest and save their money. An early example was Bank of America’s Keep the Change program, which rounded up purchases and moved the change to savings accounts. The Need for Passive Investment A few years back, the Lawnmower app came to fruition, enabling users to do a similar thing, except their spare change went to buy a small amount of Bitcoin. It later expanded to allow for numerous blockchain assets, though it is no longer available. In the traditional investing space, the Acorns app is all the rage, enabling users to do the same thing with the traditional stock market. Everyday Americans have been increasingly interested in venture capitalism since the dawn of the dotcom boom, and CNBC’s Shark Tank, now in its tenth season, while a poor example of how VC meetings go, has the popularity to demonstrate this fact. Occasionally, technological innovations cross the stage of Shark Tank, and this week’s episode featured a creation of interest to crypto enthusiasts: the Bundil app, a Lawnmower-style application that enables users to invest their spare change in cryptocurrency. Passive investment options like Bundil and Acorns are an important part of the 21st-century financial landscape. In the past, the best an everyday person could do was hire someone they hoped could manage their money successfully. Too many examples of fraud and theft took place in that era to list. Whenever you put a great deal of value in a centralized location and give one person or a small group of people in full control of it, bad things can and will happen. The era of the blockchain makes such instances rarer. Kevin O’Leary Goes in for $100K Of Shark Tank’s investor lineup, Mark Cuban is the most likely to invest in blockchain technologies. However, already having money in several including the untraceable messaging platform Dust and being an advisor on the Mercury protocol, he said he’s already invested in a similar platform to Bundil and passed on the offer. Perhaps the heel of the show, Kevin O’Leary is often mocked by his fellow Shark Tank investors and rarely actually strikes a deal on the show. Being that all the other sharks backed out, O’Leary was Bundil creator Dmitri Love’s last hope. Love was offering a 10% stake in his company for $100,000, thereby valuing the application at $1 million. O’Leary asked a surprising question for a balding millionaire investor: “Which cryptos does it support?” Love responded that it supports Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Ethereum. O’Leary was no nicer to Love than he is to anyone, and demanded 50% of the company in exchange for $100,000, effectively devaluing the company by 80%. He said, “You are going to fail within 36 months.” Matt Higgins suggested that Love should partner with existing exchanges to expand his reach, and Cuban notably said this was a good way to kill the business while trying to grow it. Higgins said that competing products were too easy to build. After all the other sharks had backed out, O’Leary reiterated that he would be a 50/50 partner at $100,000, or he would also back out. Love seemed displeased with the offer, noting that “50% is a lot,” but ultimately accepted the investment from Kevin O’Leary. This effectively means that Bundil now has the star power and reach of a famous investor. Love created Bundil as an answer to friends and family who continually pestered him about the perils of investing in cryptocurrency. It’s hard to convince people that they should risk real money on something they hardly understand. Acquiring Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies comes with its own set of hurdles, so by the time an only-casually-interested party gets to where they can actually buy some coin, they’ve probably lost interest. In this way, passive investment apps are extremely important for the viability of cryptocurrency as a whole. Love told the sharks: “I thought, ‘Man, you know, anyone that’s trying to invest in cryptocurrency has to go through all these steps to try to figure out how to buy it. And I thought there could be an easier way for it to be done.” Bundil costs $3 per month or $24 per year. It connects to your chosen payment method and slowly grows your Bitcoin balance. For those cautious or cash-strapped, it and other similar methods are potentially the only realistic way to introduce themselves to the important new world that is cryptocurrency.

      "The value of bitcoin hit an all-time high of nearly $20,000 in December 2017. Less than a year later, however, its value has dropped to about $6,400, according to digital-currency website CoinDesk, whose Bitcoin Price Index tracks prices from several key exchanges. Still, even though bitcoin is worth a lot less today than it was at its peak, if you invested $1,000 five years ago, you would have made a profit. While the value of one bitcoin hit highs of around $1,000 and lows below $600 during December 2013, when the cryptocurrency began to go mainstream, it hovered around $1,000 early in the month. A bitcoin purchased at $1,000 would be worth about $6,400 Thursday, or over six times as much, and your total gain would be over $5,000. This estimate does not include any additional fees or transaction costs. If you bought bitcoin at its high near $20,000, $15,000, or even at $10,000, though, you would have lost money: around $13,600, $8,600 or $3,600, respectively. CoinDesk: Bitcoin Price Index from Oct. 25, 2013, to Oct. 25, 2018 Volatility is pretty common for cryptocurrencies. Ethereum, once valued near $1,300, according to digital-currency tracker coinmarketcap, is now hovering around $200. Digital currencies XRP and Litecoin have seen similar declines. Thats part of the reason seasoned investors say to use caution when approaching crypto. Billionaire entrepreneur Mark Cuban and \"Oracle of Omaha\" Warren Buffett, for example, have both warned that bitcoins value is unstable. Legendary investor and Vanguard founder Jack Bogle, at a Council on Foreign Relations event, told the audience, \"Avoid bitcoin like the plague.\"\n",

      "Stock market darling Advanced Micro Devices appears to be a darling no more. The company, which makes microchips to power PCs and servers as well as video graphics cards, saw its share price shrivel by almost 25% in trading just on Wednesday through midday on Thursday. It’s been a wild ride this year for investors in AMD, which—regardless of the market gyrations—has been benefitting from a long-term chip redesign effort under CEO Lisa Su. AMD shares ended 2017 at $10.28, rose above $34 last month, and have since sold off considerably to trade at $19.40 midday on Thursday. At the height, AMD’s shares had more than tripled. Now they have fallen a total of 43% from that recent high, hit back on Sept. 13. The immediate catalyst for the sell-off this week was the company’s third quarter earnings report on Wednesday, along with the general market weakness among tech stocks. AMD’s revenue increased 4% to $1.65 billion for the quarter, slightly short of Wall Street analyst estimates, but the company’s forecast of $1.45 billion for fourth quarter revenue, which would represent an 8% gain, was a deeper miss versus Wall Street expectations. Still, the real story of AMD’s highs and lows is a complex tale related to the growth of its revamped line up of chips for PCs, servers and graphics, the ups and downs of the cryptocurrency market, and the stumbles of primary competitor Intel. To start, Su oversaw a wholesale redesign of AMD’s chip lineup to focus on higher performance that started delivering new products last year and saw second generation updates go on sale in 2018. Strong reviews and solid sales of the Ryzen chip for PCs, Epyc server chips, and Vega graphic chip drove AMD’s sales through the first nine months of this year to $5.1 billion, up 29% from the same period of last year. That’s also produced a net income of $299 million versus a loss of $14 million in 2017. But some of the sales boost had little to do with new products and resulted instead from the unsustainable boom in cryptocurrencies. People who wanted to crunch the calculations that lead to the creation of new digital coins, known as digital currency miners, often rely on graphics cards using chips from AMD and Nvidia (nvda). As cryptocurrency prices peaked, demand for graphics cards shot up. But lately prices have slumped and the resulting drop in demand showed up in AMD’s third quarter results. AMD said graphics chip sales related to mining made up almost 10% of sales total revenue in the third quarter last year, or about $150 million, versus almost nothing in this year’s quarter. That fall off was steeper than Wall Street, and maybe some AMD executives, expected. The final issue driving AMD’s stock price has been all of the problems at Intel, which lost its CEO in June and has been struggling to move its manufacturing process to cutting-edge techniques for several years. Intel admitted at the end of July that its much delayed 10-nanometer chip line, first expected to arrive back in 2015, wouldn’t be available in high volumes until the end of next year. AMD’s shares closed at $18.94 the day before Intel’s announcement and subsequently spent the next six weeks skyrocketing as investors dreamed that Intel’s delay would open the door for a massive sales increase. Lately, Intel (intc) has been offering more optimistic information and releasing chips that, at least on paper, appear to be strong competitors for AMD’s (amd) products, with or without the 10-nanometer process. A part of the disappointment with AMD’s third and (projected) fourth quarter revenue stemmed from a failure of the company to cash in quite as significantly as some hoped from Intel’s troubles. As longtime chip industry analyst Stacy Rasgon at Bernstein Research summed up in a report on Thursday: “It is clear that expectations got significantly overheated over the last few months, and now must come back down to earth, with the question of ultimate earnings power (and what one wants to pay for it) remaining up in the air even if the core businesses are on track.”\n",

      "The Spanish Ministry of Finance has closed a legal loophole allowing holders of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to skirt asset declaration laws. Announcing a draft anti-fraud law approved by the Council of Ministers earlier today, Finance Minister María Jesús Montero explained that the new law will mandate “the identification of the holders and the balances contributed by these virtual currencies,” obligating crypto asset holders to declare all cryptocurrency asset holdings. Spanish daily newspaper ABC.es reports that Montero further stated that all Spaniards with offshore currency holdings in fiat or crypto must declare these holdings in an annual declaration to Spain’s Agencia Tributaria. New Spanish Taxation Measures Affecting Crypto Holders The draft law is intended to raise a further 850 million euros in tax revenue at a time when Spain is in desperate need of extra government revenue to fund investment and welfare spending in a country with 33.8 percent youth unemployment. To assist revenue generation efforts, the Spanish government has introduced a draft bill to impose a 0.2 percent tax on purchases of listed shares valued at more than a billion euros. Whether this will have any impact on cryptocurrency investment remains unclear at the moment as no further information was forthcoming at press time. In what may possibly be significant news for crypto traders depending on the Spanish government’s interpretation of crypto trading as a commercial activity, the so-called “Tobin tax” provision in the draft bill states that intraday net transactions will be taxed, which means that users buying and selling several assets in the same session will only be taxed based on their position at the start of trading and at close, regardless of the number of trades that took place during the period in question. ABC.es also reports that a taskforce made up of 200 officials will be mobilized to monitor tax evasion and tax defaulters who owe the Spanish Treasury 600,000 euros or more, which is significantly down from the previous threshold of 1 million euros. This effort will be assisted with the creation of a framework for supplying VAT information immediately. The list of countries designated as tax havens will also be expanded as the Spanish government looks to block all available loopholes for tax avoidance. In July, CCN reported that five countries namely, the UK, US, Australia, Canada and the Netherlands created the Joint Chiefs of Global Tax Enforcement (J5) partnership aimed at combating transnational tax evasion and money laundering.\n",

      "TrueUSD (TUSD), Circle Coin (USDC), Gemini Dollar (GUSD), and Paxos (PAX), new generation stablecoins competing against Tether (USDT), are all based on the Ethereum blockchain network. Crucially, all of the three above mentioned stablecoins are fully audited, transparent, and regulated, which allow them to obtain stable banking services and guarantee the ability of consumers to redeem the tokens based on a 1:1 ration with the US dollar. Ethereum-Based Tokens Deploying a stablecoin on top of the Ethereum blockchain protocol instantaneously improves the compatibility of the asset with existing infrastructure. For instance, users of GUSD, PAX, and TUSD can utilize hardware wallets like Trezor and Ledger along with software wallets such as Metamask to send and receive stablecoins. “Improved send and receive. Two Ethereum wallets can quickly send and receive any amount of USDC at any time of day. Large transfers for business purposes become as easy as small e-commerce payments. Consumers can use the Coinbase app to send USDC to someone, while remaining confident the value is stable,” the Coinbase team explained, which recently integrated USDC with Circle. It also allows exchanges to easily integrate stablecoins without the necessity of creating a new infrastructure to support stablecoins. The Coinbase team emphasized that the usage of the Ethereum blockchain network enables developers to program the dollar, which allows fintech companies to develop programs that can easily and securely facilitate stablecoin transactions. “A programmable dollar. For developers and fintech companies, a digital dollar like USDC is easier to program with. For example, given the private keys for USDC, a program can easily send and receive them back and forth using the public Ethereum blockchain.” Most importantly, with stablecoins launched on Ethereum, users can track the circulation of the tokens with block explorers like Etherscan. Because the tokens are stored in smart contracts, users can track the amount of US dollars stored in a particular stablecoin, increasing the overall transparency of the currency. Subsequent to its launch, the Gemini team heavily emphasized the fact that GUSD is built on the Ethereum network with compliance with the ERC20 token contract standard, due to the various benefits the compatibility with Ethereum can provide. “To date, there has been no trusted and regulated digital representation of the U.S. dollar that moves in an open, decentralized manner like cryptocurrencies. Enter the Gemini dollar — a stable value coin (often called a “stablecoin”) that is (i) issued by Gemini, a New York trust company, (ii) strictly pegged 1:1 to the U.S. dollar, and (iii) built on the Ethereum network according to the ERC20 standard for tokens.” Cryptocurrency is in a Growth Curve The cryptocurrency market and industry are in a growth curve. In the years to come, as infrastructure surrounding the cryptocurrency market strengthens, opaque, inefficient, and unregulated platforms, assets, and projects will be replaced with more practical, transparent, and regulated alternatives. The stablecoin market has seen the emergence of new competitors against Tether that are transparent, regulated, and compliant with the existing infrastructure in the market.

CCN urges readers to conduct their own research with due diligence into the company, product or service mentioned in the press release. Available now on Android and iOS, the free app offers cryptocurrency holders a better user experience, with virtual financial asset banking, transfer, investment, and more. QORMI, MALTA (Oct. 15, 2018) — Noomi Wallet, a brand new, cryptocurrency banking application developed by a dedicated team of blockchain experts, officially launched today for Android and iOS devices. The digital wallet, which aims to make cryptocurrency in everyday life a mainstream reality, is designed to be both practical and easy to use. Serious crypto investors now have a place they can invest their virtual financial assets, or VFAs, in high-yield Bitcoin and Ethereum accounts. And thanks to the streamlined user interface, it’s the perfect app for crypto fans to introduce their family, friends, and associates — i.e. those who may not be as familiar with or comfortable using crypto — to the emerging world of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other VFAs. Among the core features: Invest and grow your VFAs — Open a Bitcoin or Ethereum investment account with fixed, guaranteed APRs. Support for all your VFAs — Noomi already supports some of the world’s most popular cryptocurrencies, which you can store safely in this easy-to-use wallet. These include Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH) and ERC20 tokens, CyberMiles Token (CMT), and more to come. Instant and free transfers and withdrawals — Instantly transfer VFAs to your friends on Noomi for free. W allet staking (coming soon) — Noomi is the first—and only—way for people who don’t have CMT cubes to participate still in block rewards and staking. These features offer immediate value to users and are the first part of an overall vision of building a compelling VFA services solution for the blockchain ecosystem: “Cryptocurrency is giving rise to new ways of interacting with money and commerce,” Andrew Dao, CEO of Noomi said. “There are countless promising new blockchains and tokens being launched that strive to innovate entire industries, unlock new value for users, and create something better and unique. We believe the innovation and creativity of this blockchain-based ecosystem will evolve the way business, commerce, and finance is done, a change that cannot happen overnight.” In addition to its primary VFA banking and payment transfer functions, Noomi sets itself further apart from other crypto wallets on the market by: Empowering users to invest their BTC and ETH like fiat. Noomi works with VFA managers to let users deposit VFAs into investment accounts, with guaranteed returns, great rates (6-10 percent p.a.), and short investment periods (14-30 days). Enabling usernames that you can remember. In addition to a standard wallet address, all Noomi users can choose a unique username for themselves and share that name with other users so that they can send or request cryptocurrency from you instantly. Erasing gas fees. Within the Noomi network, users can send cryptocurrency to each other instantly and for free. When sending outside the Noomi network, Noomi will pay the gas fee* for the supported VFAs. Eliminating the need to have a separate wallet app for different cryptocurrencies. Store and manage all of them in the Noomi Wallet, it’s as simple as that. Furthermore, Noomi’s team is in the process of applying for the Malta government-issued license to store, transfer and manage VFAs, making it one of the first crypto wallets in the world in full compliance with Malta VFA laws and regulations. “Our goal for Noomi is not only to support a new blockchain ecosystem, but also to assist the transition from traditional to blockchain-based practices by providing the critical layers of banking, payment processing, and investment services that tie it all together,” Dao said. “Moreover, we’re doing it in a way that benefits the people and businesses who are pioneers in this change. This app of ours is the first step.” Noomi has partnered with CyberMiles, a new public blockchain for e-commerce, as part of the CyberMiles ecosystem. Noomi is one of more than two dozen “Supernode” candidates for the CyberMiles’ blockchain, which is set for release this week. This strategic move is intended to position Noomi as not only a leader in the VFA services space but also a critical link in the DPoS consensus protocol that will power the CyberMiles network. “Till now, blockchain technology has been geared largely toward technical advancements or improvements like public ledgers and smart contracts,” Dr. Lucas Lu, founder, and CEO of the CyberMiles Foundation said. “While more and more people hear about cryptocurrency every day, few of us actually own it. Its potential to revolutionize how we pay, share information, and even how we interact with each other is yet to be realized. Expanding our ecosystem, we’re confident about paving the way for regular consumers to experience the benefits of cryptocurrency like never before.” Noomi already has undergone a professional security audit to ensure the safety of the VFAs held by the wallet and the users’ personal information. To learn more about the Noomi Wallet, go to noomiwallet.com, or join Noomi’s Telegram community at t.me/noomiofficial. *For a limited time only, Noomi is offering zero gas fees on any ERC20 token transaction from a Noomi user to a non-Noomi user. While CMT will be included as well, ETH and BTC transactions do not qualify for this promotional period. About Noomi Wallet Noomi was created to make virtual financial asset management and investment easy, secure, and most importantly, profitable. Our team of blockchain experts have banded together to build the best-in-class virtual financial asset investment and management platform that combines the traditional wallet with investment features to help you earn more no matter how the market is performing. Building on our team’s experience partnering with successful blockchain projects, we are offering an innovative new way for users to manage their virtual financial assets.

      "It’s been 10 years since bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto published his white paper on bitcoin, and the global economy hasn’t been the same since. The original cryptocurrency now boasts a market cap of more than $112 billion, while bitcoin’s dominance hovers at more than 53%. But if you ask Nigel Green, founder and CEO of financial advisory firm deVere Group, which boasts $10 billion in AUM, the next 10 years will look a lot different than bitcoin’s first decade. He’s quick to attribute the “crypto revolution” to bitcoin, saying that it has changed the way money is transacted forever. Green’s outlook, however, is a mixed bag, with bitcoin’s “influence and dominance of the cryptocurrency sector” expected to “drastically reduce” while the value of the broader crypto market is poised to expand by 5,000%, which would attach a combined market cap of $20 trillion in the coming decade. Green stated in a press release: “[While] I don’t wish to rain on anyone’s parade, I believe that Bitcoin’s influence and dominance of the cryptocurrency sector will drastically reduce in its second decade. This is because as mass adoption of cryptocurrency grows, more and more digital assets will be launched – by organizations in both the private and the public sectors. This will increase competition for Bitcoin and dent its market share.” Ripple (XRP) and ETH to Steal Bitcoin’s Shine Green, whose firm is based in Dubai but has offices around the world, pointed to other reasons for the forecast, such as better technology, features, and solutions to problems that competing cryptocurrencies will provide, coins like ripple (XRP) and ethereum. He told CCN: “I believe that…XRP will be one of the main digital assets to dent Bitcoin’s market share over the next few years due to its apparent focus on integrating with banks and other financial institutions.” XRP already muscled ETH out of the No. 2 spot for cryptocurrencies on CoinMarketCap more than once this year, though it has since fallen back to the No. 3 spot. Meanwhile, despite the fact that ETH has fallen out of favor with the crypto community of late, Green remains bullish on the future though he falls short of calling for a “flippening” event. “Another one would be its current main challenger Ethereum. This is because a growing number of platforms are adopting Ethereum as a means of trading; there’s an increasing use of smart contracts by Ethereum; and due to the decentralization of cloud computing.” Even if bitcoin’s dominance fades, Green says there is a clear shift among retail and institutional investors away from fiat money and into crypto, one whose momentum will only intensify in the coming decade. As a result, he expects “the market will have grown beyond recognition when Bitcoin celebrates its 20th anniversary.” Featured Image from Shutterstock\n",

Bitcoin Press Release: ColossusXT offers a cryptocurrency that tackles issues currently plaguing digital Coins of today by bringing speed, efficiency, and privacy. The Colossus Grid is a framework for sharing and utilizing computational power and storage. October 24th, 2018, Wyoming, USA – Blockchain startup ColossusXT will address multiple digital coin issues with its decentralized grid, offering superior levels of speed, efficiency, and privacy than the majority of alternatives. In a sea of digital Coins, ColossusXT aims to stand out, using a framework called Colossus Grid. ColossusXT provides an energy efficient method of supercomputing and offers a series of unique attributes that separate it from many alternative coins of a similar nature. For example, some coins have just one layer of privacy where ColossusXT and the Colossus Grid will utilize two layers of privacy through Obfuscation Zerocoin Protocol, and Armis (I2P) I2P. These will protect users of the Colossus Grid as they utilize grid resources. ColossusXT uses Masternodes and Proof of Stake which both contributes to reducing 51% attacks, along with instant transactions and zero-fee transactions. This protection is paramount as ColossusXT evolves into the Colossus Grid. Grid Computing will have a pivotal role throughout the world, and this means is that users will begin to experience the Internet as a seamless computational universe. Software applications, databases, sensors, video, and audio streams-all will be reborn as services that live in cyberspace, assembling and reassembling themselves on the fly to meet the tasks at hand. Once plugged into the grid, a desktop machine will draw computational horsepower from all the other computers on the grid. PoS vs PoW Users do not have to have a large number of coins in order to stake on PoS. This will determine how often they are rewarded but can stake with as little as 1000 ColossusXT (COLX). Staking Calculator: https://calculator.colossusxt.io/staking ColossusXT also has two security protections that are not offered with PoW. PoS provides more security to prevent bad actors from attacking the chain. The company’s second layer is Master-node Technology. ColossusXT’s (TPS) is also currently faster than Litecoin, and has a feature for zero-fee transactions. Providing Solutions Instead of using more complex protocols to create workaround the above-mentioned issues, CollosusXT gives simpler solutions. The problem that ColossusXT addresses a lack of computational power to process all the DATA. (There are thousands of teraflops of DATA every day), ColossusXT will provide an innovative solution, which is to use already existing computing power through the Colossus Grid, which can then be utilized to analyze the DATA as well as storing DATA through the Colossus Grid’s decentralized storage.

      "Over the past 24 hours, the crypto market has added $2 billion to its valuation, rising to $210 billion. The Bitcoin price has experienced a slight increase in price from $6,370 to $6,430, supported by a minor rise in daily trading volume. Still, the volume of the cryptocurrency exchange market remains weak, with the daily trading volume of Bitcoin remaining below $3.5 billion on Coinmarketcap and $2.42 billion on CoinCap. XRP, the native currency of the Ripple blockchain protocol, has surged by around 3 percent on October 24, possibly due to the approval of Coinbase Custody by the New York Department of Financial Services to operate as a regulated custodian facilitating investments in Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Ripple, and Litecoin. “Coinbase Custody Trust Company will operate as a standalone, independently-capitalized business to Coinbase Inc. and will be held to the same compliance, security and capital requirements as traditional fiduciary custodial businesses like the DTC,” Coinbase Custody product lead Sam McIngvale said. Same Trend For Months Since August, the price trend of Bitcoin has remained in the range of $6,300 to $6,800, failing to break out of the $6,800 resistance level apart from one occasion in mid-September. As such, technical analyst DonAlt stated that in a period of stability, rather than initiating high risk trades, it is safer to observe the market and the short-term price trend of Bitcoin. “Updating the daily chart doesn’t really make much sense, it’s been the same thing for days now. That’s why you get the 4H chart with the zones I’m watching. Before any of these anything but longing S and shorting R makes little sense.” Most traders in the cryptocurrency community echoed a similar sentiment, emphasizing that until the dominant cryptocurrency engages in a major price movement on the downside and the upside, it will be difficult for traders to predict the trend of the market. “Look for longs in the lower 1/3 of the range and shorts in the upper 1/3 of the range. Rinse and repeat until it doesn’t work any more. It really can be that easy,” cryptocurrency trader Mayne said. In previous weeks, when the price of Bitcoin made a move near the $6,700 to $6,800 range, the volume of the asset increased to around $4 billion, which it held relatively well throughout August and September. Yet, over the past two weeks, BTC has struggled to see an increase in its volume, remaining below the $3.5 billion mark. Where the Market Goes Next Investors expect the prices of major cryptocurrencies to increase in the months to come, particularly in December, as interest towards the Bakkt BTC futures market rise prior to its launch. In terms of market development and infrastructure strengthening, the cryptocurrency market is in an ideal position to initiate a short-term rally, supported by the months of stability demonstrated by BTC. Still, due to the lack of momentum and trading activity in the market, the trend of major digital assets remains uncertain. Featured Image from Shutterstock. Charts from TradingView.\n",

      "(This story corrects paragraph four to show non-profit group helps all refugees, not only Jewish refugees) A woman places flowers on an impromptu memorial at the Tree of Life synagogue where 11 worshippers were murdered during Saturdays shooting at the synagogue in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, U.S., October 28, 2018. REUTERS/Cathal McNaughton By Trevor Hunnicutt and Paresh Dave (Reuters) - Gab.com, the website where the suspected Pittsburgh synagogue gunman posted anti-Semitic views, said on Sunday it was offline for a period of time after being asked by its domain provider to move to another registrar. The move comes after GoDaddy Inc (GDDY.N) asked Gab to change the domain, while PayPal Holdings Inc (PYPL.O), Stripe Inc and Joynet Inc blocked the website. “We have informed Gab.com that they have 24 hours to move the domain to another registrar,” a spokesman for GoDaddy said, adding the site violated its terms of service and hosted content that “promotes and encourages violence against people.” The 46-year-old suspect Robert Bowers in the shooting incident has been charged with murdering 11 people on Saturday in the deadliest attack ever on the Jewish community in the United States. Hours earlier, he posted on Gab.com, saying a non-profit that helps refugees relocate to the country was helping to kill “my people.” “Gab.com is under attack. We have been systematically no-platformed by App Stores, multiple hosting providers, and several payment processors,” the website said, adding that it was working around the clock to get Gab.com back online. PayPal banned the website from using its money-sending services on Saturday. Gab said on Saturday it received notice it would be blocked by another payments website, Stripe Inc, and had switched to a new web-hosting service after Joyent Inc warned it would cut off the website. Gab did not say who the new web host was. The company posted on Twitter on Sunday, “FREE SPEECH WILL ALWAYS WIN.” Founded in 2016 by conservative Andrew Torba, Gab bills itself as the “free speech” alternative to Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) and Facebook Inc (FB.O) and has become a popular place to post content unwelcome or prohibited on other platforms. Bowers, 46, joined the site in January. Notable users include right-wing provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos and Andrew Anglin, the founder of the neo-Nazi Daily Stormer website, as well as media personalities Alex Jones and Carl Benjamin. The free website charges for access to additional features and also raises money on the crowdfunding website StartEngine. Torba did not respond to a request for comment on Sunday. Utsav Sanduja, Gab’s former chief operating officer, said the company and its mission will survive “guilt by association” and could do more fundraising through cryptocurrencies in order to bypass tech companies. “We created Gab for the purpose of letting off steam not to kill. That was not our intention,” he said. In earlier statements, the website said it was cooperating with law enforcement authorities and described the moves by PayPal and others as acts of “direct collusion between big tech giants.” It also called on U.S. President Donald Trump to act. PayPal declined to comment beyond an earlier statement that the company takes immediate action when “a site is allowing the perpetuation of hate, violence or discriminatory intolerance.” Joyent could not immediately be reached, and Stripe declined to comment on individual users. Sanduja did say that there could be room for Gab to improve. “The mission should not change, but certainly there does need to be better checks and balances in place,” he said. Sanduja said he left his role at the website in June after Gab users threatened his life and that of his wife, who works at a synagogue. On Sunday, Gab’s forum lit up with comments about the Pittsburgh attack. One user celebrated Gab being banned by PayPal while another user responded, “You are going to get shot at ur local synagogue.” Another posted, “I WAS RIGHT, THEY FAKED THE SYNAGOGUE SHOOTING.” Gab raised $1 million through crowdfunding last year, but recorded a loss of $201,704, according to a document filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) said in an emailed statement that it terminated Gab’s accounts on its Azure cloud computing platform last month. Alphabet Inc’s (GOOGL.O) Google and Apple Inc’s (AAPL.O) mobile app stores previously blocked Gab, cutting off a crucial source of access to new users. Facebook’s archive of ads that it considers political in nature shows Gab has run only one such ad since May. It paid less than $100 for that ad and generated 1,000 to 5,000 views last month, according to the archive. The company had no active ad campaigns on Facebook or Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) as of Saturday, according to those companies’ ad transparency databases. Gab’s account on Twitter warned users on Saturday to expect that they would be banned from that website and Facebook soon. A Facebook spokeswoman said the company is reviewing Gab’s presence on its website. Twitter declined to comment.\n",

      "The Information Reporting Program Advisory Committee is a body which was established before the Internet was a major consumer network and is a result of federal government reorganization and, importantly, efforts to modernize and improve the IRS brought about by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1989. The committee periodically suggests actions the IRS needs to take in order to improve its operations, specifically relating to how the IRS gathers information about taxpayers. This year’s public report is of interest to cryptocurrency advocates and participants because it specifically directs the IRS that it needs to be clearer on how it deals with Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. In the past few years, with the innovative rise of technology throughout the financial sector, there has also been a rise in the popularity of investment in cryptocurrency. However, with the popularity of cryptocurency, there has also been an equal rise in questions as to the applicable tax consequences that apply to it. While we acknowledge and thank the IRS for publishing Notice 2014-21, which provides that virtual currency is treated as property for U. S. federal tax purposes, many industry and tax practitioners still question other tax consequences of cryptocurrency transactions. […] Therefore, IRPAC recommends that the IRS issue further guidance on the tax consequences of cryptocurrency transactions. The tax situation regarding cryptocurrencies has long been a subject of interest and debate in the crypto community. Unclear guidelines and the occasional prosecution of unregulated exchanges have made it difficult for users to know quite how to act, and as a result few are willing to admit they have cryptos. One problem is that cryptocurrencies and their related service providers are overseen by multiple agencies. Everyone from FinCEN, the IRS, the Treasury, other federal regulatory bodies, and state agencies have a say in how people legally use the currency. Coinbase Case Used As Example In the more detailed recommendation regarding clarification of crypto regulations at the IRS, the Committee used United States v. Coinbase Inc, a case which decided that Coinbase has no legal remedy in providing information to the IRS about transactions over $20,000. The Committee writes: A good illustration of the difficulties of tax enforcement in this area may be found in a recent case. […] During 2013 through 2015, Coinbase maintained over 4.9 million wallets in 190 countries with 3.2 million customers served and $2.5 billion exchanged. The Coinbase summons initially sought “information regarding United States persons who, at any time during the period January 1, 2013 through December 31, 2015, conducted transactions in a convertible currency as define in IRS Notice 2014-21.” That request was later narrowed to Coinbase users who “bought, sold, sent or received at least $20,000” worth of cryptocurrency in a year. The Committee believes that Americans would by and large be more open to reporting their crypto holdings and proceeds if they had more clarity in the consequences of so doing.They believe that as a result of the Coinbase summons and the lack of clarity, people will be more likely to use offshore exchanges in order to protect their assets. Many, if not most, taxpayers will report these activities correctly if they are able to determine the implications of their cryptocurrency activities. Some taxpayers will be tempted to do otherwise, however because anonymity is inherent in the structure of the blockchain activities. In light of Coinbase,these taxpayers are likely to use exchanges outside the jurisdiction of the US. It is important to note that the IRS is not required to follow the guidance of the IRPAC, but historically it has used the recommendations to modernize the way it handles its business. Those who wish to transact in cryptocurrencies legally can only hope that IRS heeds the advice of the IRPAC and implements clearer regulations in the coming months.

      "Until recently, Germany’s Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) classified bitcoin as a financial instrument, but a subsequent court ruling disclaimed this categorization and decided that the cryptocurrency does not meet this definition under the terms of the German Banking Act (KWG). Bitcoin Unrecognizable to German Legal Framework The Berlin Court of Appeal in September dismissed a criminal proceeding against the operator of a local bitcoin trading platform. The German enforcement had arrested the administrator for facilitating the trades of financial instruments like bitcoin without obtaining a BaFin permit. While the Berlin-Tiergarten had sentenced the accused for providing financial services, the Berlin Regional Court reversed the judgment, stating that BaFin misinterpreted the legal status of bitcoin. According to Mondaq, The 4th Criminal Division of Berlin Court of Appeal favored the regional court’s ruling, confirming that the German regulators extended the scope of criminal law to bitcoin without synchronizing it with the banking acts. Citing Section 1(11) of the KWG, the appeal court stated that neither the central bank nor any public authority issues bitcoin. The digital currency lacks general recognition and a stable value that could allow its use to compare goods or services. Therefore, it cannot gain the status of units of account – or financial instruments — contrary to what was enforced by the BaFin in May 2018. The judgment also shed light on the matters related to the sale and purchase of bitcoin in Germany. The court, reading Section 1(32), ruled that bitcoin trading is not subjected to permits or licenses, and consequently – per Section 1(54) – was not a criminal offense. Due to these facts alone, BaFin couldn’t extend the scope of criminal penalties on the accused. The appeal court also criticized the financial regulator for crossing the boundaries of federal authorities, stating that it was not their responsibility “to exercise a modifying influence (in particular) on criminal laws.” Regulatory Inconsistencies Deepen The court ruling has deepened the inconsistencies in the ways each European country interprets bitcoin law. The European Union has passed a motion in 2016 that enabled taxation of cryptocurrency holdings, investments, and profits. The provision, however, didn’t settle any definition for cryptocurrencies as a whole. Individual countries in the Eurozone awarded bitcoin a legal status in their jurisdictions, but the digital currency never attained a particular Europe-wide regulatory framework for itself. Jörg von Minckwitz, President of Bitwala, a blockchain banking service based out of Germany, believes each European country should get on the same page before writing the first bitcoin bill. “In the past years, Bitwala has repeatedly spoken out in favor of legal clarity and a regulatory level playing field in the EU,” he said in a statement provided to CCN. “As digitization affects society across borders, this can only be done in unison. Currently, every EU country seems to have their interpretation, which results in regulatory arbitrage to the detriment of German consumers and innovators.” BaFin, after the court ruling, cannot penalize people holding or trading cryptocurrencies unless it joins hands with lawmakers to create new legal provisions to modify the KWG. As for now, bitcoin and similar digital assets will be subjected to European regulations. Images from Shutterstock\n",

      "Riksbank, Sweden’s Central Bank, is adapting to the shifting financial landscape in the country where the transition to a cashless society has accelerated quickly. Several banks in Sweden no longer handle cash, which is a problem some groups of people who struggle to adapt to new technologies, such as the elderly. The central bank believes that a state-backed digital option is necessary in order to maintain the stability of the country’s financial system. Some Swedes have reportedly been skeptical of the development of the e-Krona, but this has not slowed the bank’s push to develop it. The e-Krona will at first be something used in addition to cash, but eventually it will become a primary financial instrument within Sweden. The bank believes that without a faster development effort, private entities may have too much responsibility in the payments sector, which could lead to problems. Specifically, they want to avoid making private institutions “take all the responsibility for ensuring that payments function in crisis situations.” The bank writes: There are currently groups in society that are encountering problems as cash use declines because they find it difficult to use digital payment solutions for one reason or another. Such groups include older people, people with disabilities or those who, for different reasons, do not have access to payment instruments other than cash. Since it cannot be expected that the private market fully cater for these groups, the state can choose to take greater responsibility for them. Sweden Leads the Way The bank suggests that a pilot program should be in place in 2019 with full implementation by 2021. It is important to note that while the new currency might share characteristics with cryptocurencies, it is actually still to be a fiat currency administered, owned, and regulated by a state entity, so its similarities are in fact moreso with the existing fiat currency. In its report, the bank considers other options simultaneously with the issuance of the e-Krona, including “subsidizing” cash usage. “To facilitate and increase cash usage, the Riksbank could choose to subsidise cash, either directly or indirectly, For example, we could fully or partly return to the 1980s structure of Riksbank branches across the entire country and the comprehensive service to banks and other market participants that waws previously provided to the banks largely for free,” the report added. “This would reduce the banks’ costs for cash, allowing them to provide a greater range of cash services. Ultimately, this could make it easier and more attractive for private individuals, retailers and other actors to handle cash. […] However, as a matter of principle, the Riksbank’s opinion is that all means of payment should carry their own costs and various charges should be based on actual costs.” Sweden will be the first country to implement a full-fledged digital currency as an official and overt act. However, it is unlikely to be the last. For many reasons, cash and other paper instruments are on the way out. Although it remains the best way to transact peer-to-peer, the risk it entails and its methods of issuance and counterfeit are precisely the factors that created a need for cryptocurrencies in the first place.

      "(This story corrects paragraph four to show non-profit group helps all refugees, not only Jewish refugees) A woman places flowers on an impromptu memorial at the Tree of Life synagogue where 11 worshippers were murdered during Saturdays shooting at the synagogue in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, U.S., October 28, 2018. REUTERS/Cathal McNaughton By Trevor Hunnicutt and Paresh Dave (Reuters) - Gab.com, the website where the suspected Pittsburgh synagogue gunman posted anti-Semitic views, said on Sunday it was offline for a period of time after being asked by its domain provider to move to another registrar. The move comes after GoDaddy Inc (GDDY.N) asked Gab to change the domain, while PayPal Holdings Inc (PYPL.O), Stripe Inc and Joynet Inc blocked the website. “We have informed Gab.com that they have 24 hours to move the domain to another registrar,” a spokesman for GoDaddy said, adding the site violated its terms of service and hosted content that “promotes and encourages violence against people.” The 46-year-old suspect Robert Bowers in the shooting incident has been charged with murdering 11 people on Saturday in the deadliest attack ever on the Jewish community in the United States. Hours earlier, he posted on Gab.com, saying a non-profit that helps refugees relocate to the country was helping to kill “my people.” “Gab.com is under attack. We have been systematically no-platformed by App Stores, multiple hosting providers, and several payment processors,” the website said, adding that it was working around the clock to get Gab.com back online. PayPal banned the website from using its money-sending services on Saturday. Gab said on Saturday it received notice it would be blocked by another payments website, Stripe Inc, and had switched to a new web-hosting service after Joyent Inc warned it would cut off the website. Gab did not say who the new web host was. The company posted on Twitter on Sunday, “FREE SPEECH WILL ALWAYS WIN.” Founded in 2016 by conservative Andrew Torba, Gab bills itself as the “free speech” alternative to Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) and Facebook Inc (FB.O) and has become a popular place to post content unwelcome or prohibited on other platforms. Bowers, 46, joined the site in January. Notable users include right-wing provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos and Andrew Anglin, the founder of the neo-Nazi Daily Stormer website, as well as media personalities Alex Jones and Carl Benjamin. The free website charges for access to additional features and also raises money on the crowdfunding website StartEngine. Torba did not respond to a request for comment on Sunday. Utsav Sanduja, Gab’s former chief operating officer, said the company and its mission will survive “guilt by association” and could do more fundraising through cryptocurrencies in order to bypass tech companies. “We created Gab for the purpose of letting off steam not to kill. That was not our intention,” he said. In earlier statements, the website said it was cooperating with law enforcement authorities and described the moves by PayPal and others as acts of “direct collusion between big tech giants.” It also called on U.S. President Donald Trump to act. PayPal declined to comment beyond an earlier statement that the company takes immediate action when “a site is allowing the perpetuation of hate, violence or discriminatory intolerance.” Joyent could not immediately be reached, and Stripe declined to comment on individual users. Sanduja did say that there could be room for Gab to improve. “The mission should not change, but certainly there does need to be better checks and balances in place,” he said. Sanduja said he left his role at the website in June after Gab users threatened his life and that of his wife, who works at a synagogue. On Sunday, Gab’s forum lit up with comments about the Pittsburgh attack. One user celebrated Gab being banned by PayPal while another user responded, “You are going to get shot at ur local synagogue.” Another posted, “I WAS RIGHT, THEY FAKED THE SYNAGOGUE SHOOTING.” Gab raised $1 million through crowdfunding last year, but recorded a loss of $201,704, according to a document filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) said in an emailed statement that it terminated Gab’s accounts on its Azure cloud computing platform last month. Alphabet Inc’s (GOOGL.O) Google and Apple Inc’s (AAPL.O) mobile app stores previously blocked Gab, cutting off a crucial source of access to new users. Facebook’s archive of ads that it considers political in nature shows Gab has run only one such ad since May. It paid less than $100 for that ad and generated 1,000 to 5,000 views last month, according to the archive. The company had no active ad campaigns on Facebook or Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) as of Saturday, according to those companies’ ad transparency databases. Gab’s account on Twitter warned users on Saturday to expect that they would be banned from that website and Facebook soon. A Facebook spokeswoman said the company is reviewing Gab’s presence on its website. Twitter declined to comment.\n",

We have been systematically no-platformed by App Stores, multiple hosting providers, and several payment processors,” the website said, adding that it was working around the clock to get Gab.com back online. PayPal banned the website from using its money-sending services on Saturday. Gab said on Saturday it received notice it would be blocked by another payments website, Stripe Inc, and had switched to a new web-hosting service after Joyent Inc warned it would cut off the website. Gab did not say who the new web host was. The company posted on Twitter on Sunday, “FREE SPEECH WILL ALWAYS WIN.” Founded in 2016 by conservative Andrew Torba, Gab bills itself as the “free speech” alternative to Twitter Inc and Facebook Inc and has become a popular place to post content unwelcome or prohibited on other platforms. Bowers, 46, joined the site in January. Notable users include right-wing provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos and Andrew Anglin, the founder of the neo-Nazi Daily Stormer website, as well as media personalities Alex Jones and Carl Benjamin. The free website charges for access to additional features and also raises money on the crowdfunding website StartEngine. Torba did not respond to a request for comment on Sunday. Utsav Sanduja, Gab’s former chief operating officer, said the company and its mission will survive “guilt by association” and could do more fundraising through cryptocurrencies in order to bypass tech companies. “We created Gab for the purpose of letting off steam not to kill. That was not our intention,” he said. In earlier statements, the website said it was cooperating with law enforcement authorities and described the moves by PayPal and others as acts of “direct collusion between big tech giants.” It also called on U.S. President Donald Trump to act. PayPal declined to comment beyond an earlier statement that the company takes immediate action when “a site is allowing the perpetuation of hate, violence or discriminatory intolerance.” Joyent could not immediately be reached, and Stripe declined to comment on individual users. Sanduja did say that there could be room for Gab to improve. “The mission should not change, but certainly there does need to be better checks and balances in place,” he said. Sanduja said he left his role at the website in June after Gab users threatened his life and that of his wife, who works at a synagogue. On Sunday, Gab’s forum lit up with comments about the Pittsburgh attack. One user celebrated Gab being banned by PayPal while another user responded, “You are going to get shot at ur local synagogue.” Another posted, “I WAS RIGHT, THEY FAKED THE SYNAGOGUE SHOOTING.” Gab raised $1 million through crowdfunding last year, but recorded a loss of $201,704, according to a document filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Microsoft Corp said in an emailed statement that it terminated Gab’s accounts on its Azure cloud computing platform last month. Alphabet Inc’s Google and Apple Inc’s mobile app stores previously blocked Gab, cutting off a crucial source of access to new users. Facebook’s archive of ads that it considers political in nature shows Gab has run only one such ad since May. It paid less than $100 for that ad and generated 1,000 to 5,000 views last month, according to the archive. The company had no active ad campaigns on Facebook or Twitter Inc as of Saturday, according to those companies’ ad transparency databases. Gab’s account on Twitter warned users on Saturday to expect that they would be banned from that website and Facebook soon. A Facebook spokeswoman said the company is reviewing Gab’s presence on its website. Twitter declined to comment.

    "test = \"The race to build the best public blockchain will be won by those that would scale in line with volume. On a Sunday, a blockchain project realistically did it, though for 24 hours. Waves Platform, comprising of a digital ledger project and decentralized exchange (DEX), processed 6.1 million real-time transactions in a stress test. As it found, the network faced no disruptions or delays as the test intensified. None of the transactions on its system – undertaken by users for DEX orders, transfers, token creation, etc. – experienced any slowdown, either. The Waves blockchain, according to data provided by PYWAVES, recorded a total of 108,741 transactions. Among them, 60,933 were Mass Transfers which, per Waves blog post, are specialized transactions that can hold 100 transfer at once. “A total of 6,141,108 transfers was processed by the network, with the blockchain supporting hundreds of transactions per second at peak times,” the post claimed. The platform euphorically claimed that it was the highest number of transactions ever processed by any public blockchain. Waves NG Several blockchain projects in the crypto space are attempting to find alternatives to Bitcoin’s slow transaction confirmation periods. Ethereum was posed as a solution. But, it faced the same problem CryptoKitties – a decentralized application launched on Ethereum’s blockchain – slowed down transactions on the network. While Bitcoin has opted for third-party solutions like Lightning Network to handle the volume [temporarily], Ethereum is following a test-and-implement approach by taking in answers from its community developers. Waves, to achieve a similar goal, have implemented a tech called Waves NG that helps to scale the Waves Network by selecting miners in advance, thus minimizing latency and maximizing throughput. According to Waves’ CEO and co-founder Sasha Ivanov, the protocol’s deployment on their blockchain helped them process the record transactions. “Bitcoin processes just a few transactions per second,” he said. “Ethereum’s capacity is into double-digit tps, and a handful of other blockchains have improved on this incrementally in various ways. WAVES has implemented tech that enables a step-change in transaction volumes — not just in the lab, but in the real world, on MainNet, as these figures prove beyond doubt.” The Waves post noted that other blockchain projects had not exceeded more than 2 million transactions per day. However, a tweet from Ivanov admitted that EOS, a semi-decentralized blockchain project, had in fact executed 5 million transactions within a 24-hour period. EOS had 5.5 mil at most. — Sasha Ivanov (@sasha35625) October 23, 2018 A commentator also posted a chart from Blocktivity that suggested Waves was behind five blockchain projects concerning transaction volume. The chart later earned the “bogus” status from one of the Waves followers. Featured image from Shutterstock.\"\n"
