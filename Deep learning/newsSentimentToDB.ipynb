bitcoin despite the current price slump. his optimistic views on the future of bitcoin come as he moves away from reddit and towards more venture capital initiatives, including investments in cryptocurrencies and cryptocurrency companies.following the acquisition of reddit by conde nast parent company, advance publications, ohanian has been slowly relieving himself of his day-to-day duties at the online platform. the 35-year old is now looking towards investing in more cutting-edge technologies, including instacart, and self-driving car company cruise. he has also been moving further into the cryptocurrency industry, acquiring a sizable amount of bitcoin as well as an investment in cryptocurrency exchange coinbase.ohanian is optimistic about his investments on both a fiscal and personal level, explaining that his new job as the head of his venture capital firm, initialized capital, allows for better family discussion with his wife, tennis star serena williams.while speaking about initialized capital, ohanian said:“i’ve wanted for a long time to get back to early stage founders to being the ‘first check’ in initialized. it’s a lot of fun, frankly. i get to come home and have really good dinner table conversations about the things i did at work, and it’s always [about] meeting new founders, learning about the future and then sometimes rolling up my sleeves.”ohanian bullish on bitcoin and the future of cryptocurrencydespite the current price slump in the cryptocurrency markets, falling from a market capitalization of over $800 billion in january to its yearly low of under $200 billion in august, ohanian is still incredibly optimistic about the future of the cryptocurrency markets.part of his bullishness on crypto is due to the instability of fiat currencies in countries in economic turmoil, saying:“as a store of value, there is some real traction [with bitcoin], and actually as we’re seeing in countries like turkey that are having significant economic crisis — where people are losing faith in the turkish lira — we’re going to see money move over to bitcoin because as unstable as it is, it is actually a lot more stable for a lot of people than their own nations’ fiat currency. but right now, we’re still in the earliest, earliest stages.”ohanian is referencing the overwhelming devaluation of fiat currencies in countries like turkey, who have seen their state-backed currency, the lira, decline in value by 50% since september of 2017 due to economic decline. another country that has been turning to cryptocurrency over their fiat currency is venezuela, who has seen hyperinflation of their fiat currency, the bolivar totaling an estimated 1,000,000% by the end of 2018, according to the international monetary fund.in venezuela, citizens are turning to cryptocurrencies, like dash and bitcoin, to make daily purchases, as no middle man is required to initiate or complete a transaction. dash has seen a meteoric rise in adoption in venezuela, mainly due to a massive marketing campaign in the country.the ceo of the dash core group spoke to business insider about venezuela, saying:“we are seeing tens of thousands of wallet downloads from the country each month… earlier this year, venezuela became our number two market even ahead of china and russia, which are of course huge into cryptocurrency right now.”ohanian doubled down on his bullish statement on the future of cryptocurrencies, explaining that price action doesn’t really matter right now, saying:“no matter what the currency prices are doing, seeing more and more people creating accounts … shows more and more adoption, and their end game is to be this interface between people, their fiat money and crypto — it would be the most user friendly trusted safe secure way to do it. i just encourage people not to get too, too invested in the speculation around the day-to-day trading of the currencies.”featured image from shutterstock.', 'the accused called us residents

allegedly duping several people living in the united states. acting on a tip-off, the police raided the call centre on friday and arrested the accused.“the gang members first obtained financial details of foreign nationals such as loans they had taken and their bank balances by hacking into their accounts. then they would call such people, pretending to be from tax authorities, and tell them that they owed loan tax which can be paid through bitcoins,” an officer privy to the case said.bitcoin is a form of electronic currency which is not recognised by most central banks.two years ago, the thane crime branch had unearthed a similar scam which targeted us residents.“seven workers of the fake call centre have been arrested. they don’t have any connection to the previous cases,” atul kulkarni, assistant superintendent of police, said.“we are yet to investigate the quantum of the fraud. the amount of money they obtained from the victims is yet to be ascertained,” he added.the arrested people were identified as juber shaikh (26), sabio gonsalvis (42), raju rathod (29), harsh anwar kazi (23), siddharth pillai (22), saurabh jha (29) and siddhi nair (29).in 2016, the thane

major digital asset trading platform shapeshift, said:“i don’t expect it (bear market) to end soon, although i do think that the rate of collapse has slowed considerably. generally in these bubbles, after you go through several months of a downtrend you hang out in a range for a while… but i think we are done with a majority of the collapse.”voorhees offered a relatively enthusiastic viewpoint on the trend of the crypto market, noting that while the bear market of bitcoin has evidently not ended, the worst part of the correction has slowed down.last week, researchers at diar reported that the rate of bitcoin’s volatility has dropped to a 14-month low, as btc demonstrated stability in the mid-$6,000 range since august 6, for around three weeks.as seen in previous 80 percent corrections and rallies in 2012, 2014, and 2017, bitcoin has traditionally required a period of stability before initiating a large rally on the upside.hence, the btc price demonstrating stability in the range of $6,300 to $6,700 over the past three weeks is positive, but the dominant cryptocurrency will need to show months of stability before establishing a strong foundation to support its next big rally.however, pomp has not been as optimistic as voorhees and hayes, as he wrote in his latest newsletter that he sees the price of btc falling to the $3,000 region before recovering to the $10,000 resistance level.“the final data outputs left me with a few uncomfortable conclusions. the most notable one is that we are likely to see bitcoin near $3,000 before we see bitcoin at $10,000 again. if this is true, that means we still have ~50 percent price decrease to go. things may get really, really ugly if this happens,” pomp noted.what happens to bitcoin in december?some analysts see bitcoin falling to $5,000, $4,000, and even $3,000 before recovering. but, most of the analysts share the sentiment that bitcoin will rebound to major resistance levels in the $10,000 to $15,000 range by the end of december.predictions of most experts and analysts in the cryptocurrency space change on a regular basis, as it is difficult to speculate the exact region btc will fall to and recover from. it is important for investors to look at the mid-term trend of bitcoin, analyzing actual metrics like volume and market demand to foresee the future trend of bitcoin.featured image from shutterstockadvertisement', '', 'bitcoin bitcoin price defies sec etf rejection – sign of a maturing market?bitcoin price appears to be little affected by negative news coming out from the sec concerning the possibility of a bitcoin etf.multiple etf rejections not enough to trigger bitcoin selloffsnegative news coming out one minute and btc price 00 taking a tumble the next minute. this was one of the more consistent occurrences in a seemingly unpredictable bitcoin market. everything from exchange hacks to government bans, and coinmarketcap would be dripping red.in recent times, this particular dynamic seems to have changed significantly. a few days ago, the sec denied three btc etf filings and the price of the cryptocurrency barely registered a blip. compare this with the winklevoss etf rejection and the vaneck/solidx etf delay that sent btc price into a tailspin.the sluggish price can be directly tied to the sec bitcoin etf decisions. optimistism and hope that an sec-approved etf would significantly boost btc price culminated in btc reaching $8,400 in late july.market resilience: bear-fatigue or maturing marketas with other occurrences in the market, knowing the reason for an emerging trend is of some importance. the present consensus lies somewhere between “bear-fatigue” and “market maturity” though either might be a bit premature.according to tim enneking, the managing director of crypto asset management, the market has matured to a level where obvious news like the sec btc etf rejection is to be expected. commenting on the matter, enneking said:after the most recent winklevoss rejection, virtually no one expected any of these applications to be approved.brian kelly of bkcm llc has on many occasions predicted that an sec-approved bitcoin etf in 2018 was highly unlikely. for blockforce ceo, eric ervin, the vaneck/solidx etf stands the best chance of receiving the commission’s approval.speaking to forbes, ervin expressed his belief that the market is robust enough to continue is growth and development even as more institutional investors enter the matter.it hasn’t only been doom and gloom for bitcoin and the cryptocurrency market in general over the past two months. in august, intercontinental exchange announced the launch of bakkt, a proposed digital currency trading platform in collaboration with microsoft, starbucks, and other prominent organizations.has the bitcoin market matured? let us know your thoughts in the comment section below.images courtesy of coinmarketcap.com, shutterstock', 'late friday night, elon musk announced that tesla would stay public, less than three weeks after the ceo initially tweeted that he was considering taking the electric-car company private.there were many reasons musk cited for why tesla was “better off as a public company,” but one of them particularly struck me: “there is also no proven path for most retail investors to own shares if we were private,” musk wrote in his official statement.no proven path. of course, he’s right. u.s. financial regulators restrict ownership of shares in startups and other private companies to so-called “accredited investors”—those considered wealthy enough to be able to afford the additional risks that come with owning stock that doesn’t trade on mainstream markets, making it illiquid.but there is one risky investment that retail investors can own no matter how rich (or not) they are: cryptocurrency, obviously. the u.s. securities and exchange commission doesn’t prohibit individuals from buying bitcoin and other digital assets directly—largely because it can’t, due to the decentralized structure of the blockchains on which those cryptocurrencies run. on the other hand, the sec has prevented cryptocurrency from becoming even more widely available—such as it did this week by rejecting the rest of the pending applications for bitcoin exchange-trade funds, or etfs.cryptocurrency, however, is far from “proven” when it comes to offering a responsible way for people to invest and diversify. just check out this week’s “rekt” section for various tales of individuals who lost their savings in cryptocurrency.still, i can’t help thinking that crypto could one day help provide the path that musk is looking for. it’s an idea that came up a couple of weeks ago on our show balancing the ledger, when andra capital’s haydar haba suggested creating a “tesla coin” to solve musk’s problems.there’s still a major obstacle in the way, though: haba and other entrepreneurs offering “security tokens” currently also restrict them to accredited investors in order to stay on the right side of the sec.slava rubin, co-founder and ceo of indiegogo, described on this week’s show how his company only sells its security tokens, usually backed by real estate, to those who prove their accredited status through a verification process. but he also alluded to the way tokenization could open up “a whole other asset class to more people” the same way bitcoin does for investors around the world.unlike bitcoin, though, such security tokens are backed by tangible assets with established real-world value, making them potentially safer for retail investors, rubin added. “with one of these security token offerings, you have a clear building that has customers, that has employees, that has been around for years,” he said.maybe someday the sec will allow everyone to own tokenized stock of companies—whether they’re public or private.got tips?send feedback and tips to ledger@fortune.com, find us on

for calling the 2008 financial crisis in a series of articles and presentations starting in 2006. however, roubini is no one trick pony – his research on emerging markets makes him an expert on speculative bubbles of all sorts.it’s no surprise, therefore, that he’s now sticking pins in the entire cryptocurrency/blockchain bubble of bubbles.at last week’s blockshow conference in las vegas, roubini did not mince his words. “there has been a total collapse this year in the cryptocurrency game,” he told an audience largely skeptical of his point of view. “it’s a crypto apocalypse.”deflating bitcoin and all other cryptos as wellnouriel wasted no time poking holes in every bitcoin sacred cow. for example, the claim that bitcoin can serve as money. “bitcoin is not money. to be money it would need to be a unit of account, means of payment, and a stable source of value and purchasing power,” nouriel explained. “bitcoin is none of these. other cryptos are worse.”he contrasted bitcoin and other blockchain-based payment technologies with modern payment systems like paypal , square , and alipay in china. “today’s digital systems are used by millions of people per day, and have nothing to do with blockchain,” he said.bitcoin’s second sacred cow to fall to roubini’s withering arguments: decentralization. “decentralization is a total myth,” roubini explained, as crypto miners (transaction processors), exchanges, developers, and wealth are all in fact centralized.while in theory, anybody can be a crypto miner, successful mining requires immense investment that leads to pooling of mining resources. as a result, “the top five mining pools control 70% of all mining,” roubini pointed out – mostly in places like russia, china, belarus, and other places where organized crime syndicates dominate the crypto world.centralization of wealthcrypto aficionados tout its ability to distribute wealth beyond financial insiders to anyone with a smartphone. the reality, however, is quite different. not only is 99% of crypto trading taking place on a small number of centralized exchanges, but the people with the wealth from such trading are few in number as well.to illustrate the extent that crypto centralizes wealth, roubini referred to the gini coefficient, an economic term that expresses distribution of wealth across a population from 0% (everybody equally wealthy) to 100% (one person has all the wealth.)the gini coefficient for europe, for example, is about 50%. north korea stands at 86%. and bitcoin? how about 88%. “bitcoin wealth is more concentrated than north korean wealth,” roubini pointed out.taking the wind out of tokensas i concluded in my last article, much of the activity around blockchain is nothing more than pathetic sleight-of-hand games with worthless tokens.i’m sure roubini would agree. “a world with thousands of tokens makes zero economic sense,” he said. “tokens are only good for gouging consumers.”if tokens don’t make sense, then it would follow that initial coin offerings (icos) wouldn’t make much sense either. “icos are effectively non-compliant securities,” he said, pointing out that while many ico fans position their ‘coins’ as utility tokens rather than security tokens to avoid securities laws, the reality is that they are in fact securities – and in the us at least, illegal ones.what about smart contracts?ethereum is the second most popular crypto behind bitcoin, likely because it’s possible to run ‘smart contracts’ on the ethereum blockchain. what does roubini think of smart contracts? “they’re neither smart nor contracts,” he said.they are too plagued with hard-to-fix bugs to be smart, and until the lawyers give the thumbs up, the word ‘contract’ is overly optimistic as well.furthermore, even though ethereum has become established in crypto circles, smart contracts – and the distributed apps or ‘dapps’ that leverage them – haven’t amounted to much. “75% of dapps are crypto kitties, ponzi schemes, and casino games,” roubini pointed out.where does that leave blockchain? “a peer-to-peer distributed public ledger is total nonsense,” roubini added – leaving only private, permissioned blockchain solutions with trusted individuals or organizations processing the transactions.when the scammers have milked the crypto insanity for all its worth and they and their marks have all gone home, permissioned blockchain solutions – what i refer to as ‘enterprise blockchain’ – will be all that remains.intellyx publishes the agile digital transformation

standard industry practice. image credit: blockshow.', 'advertisementthe junior united states senator from montana, steve daines, has warned that the planned closure of a coal power generator could harm the booming bitcoin mining business in the state. according to kulr-tv, all the four units of the colstrip coal plant located in rosebud county are expected to shut down by 2027.in senator daines’ view, reliable low-cost energy is necessary for montana to retain and continue attracting new bitcoin mining companies.“as the demand for bitcoin miners increases and supply of cheap, reliable electricity from coal generation decreases, this could pose a threat of the expansion of bitcoin generation and even greater threat to energy supply and prices for montana as a whole,” said senator daines during a u.s. senate energy and natural resources committee meeting.low operating costsbesides the low energy costs, the naturally-cold temperatures have also served to make the state of montana a favorite with bitcoin mining firms, as such an environment reduces cooling expenses. notably, some of the biggest bitcoin mining facilities in north america are located in western montana. this includes cryptowatt llc, which operates a facility located in butte and has an agreement with the colstrip coal plant for the supply of 64mw ,making it one of the biggest users of electricity in the state.there is also the bonner bitcoin data center, which until recently was one of the largest in the world, as ccn reported two months ago. last year, according to the missoula economic partnership, an initiative aimed at promoting business activities in the western montana city of missoula, the bonner facility was expected to expand from the then 12,000 mining rigs to 55,000.project spokanemontana’s pro-cryptocurrency bona fides are also proven by the fact that its state government is the first in the u.s. to offer a grant to a bitcoin mining operation. last year in june, the governor of montana, steve bullock, announced that out of the $1,124,030 that had been allocated as economic development grants to assist main street businesses in creating jobs, training employees, and planning for growth, $416,000 would go to a bitcoin miner named project spokane.“missoula county received $416,000 of bstf job creation funds to assist project spokane, llc to expand, which will allow the company to create 65 new jobs in bonner,” said a press release from bullock’s office. “the bstf funds will be used for purchase of equipment, machinery, furniture and software and for wage reimbursement. project spokane, llc is a data center that provides blockchain security services for the bitcoin network.”featured image from u.s. department of agriculture/flickradvertisement', 'advertisementthis week, the us securities and exchange commission (sec) has said it will review nine bitcoin exchange-traded funds (etfs) it disapproved on august 24.the letter sent to nyse group senior counsel david de gregorio by sec secretary brent fields read:“this letter is to notify you that, pursuant to rule 43 i of the commission’s rules of practice, 17 cfr 20 i .43 1, the commission will review the delegated action. in accordance with rule 431 (e), the august 22 order is stayed until the commission orders otherwise.”community is excited when they shouldn’t bejake chervinsky, a government enforcement defense & securities litigation attorney at kobre kim llp, recently explained in a statement that the revision of the etfs was initiated by sec commissioner hester peirce and that it only takes a single commissioner to order a review.last month, upon the disapproval of the winklevoss bitcoin etf, commissioner peirce expressed her optimism towards etfs and said that bitcoin etfs are worthy enough to hit us markets.according to chervinsky, the ordered revision of the nine etfs is only methodical and the outcome of the revision will lead to the same conclusion the sec disclosed on august 24.he said:“don’t get too excited, folks. under rule 431 of the sec’s rules of practice, it only takes a single commissioner to order a review like this. hester peirce deserves credit & respect for putting up a fight, but there’s no reason to think yesterday’s rejections will be reversed. final thought on bitcoin etfs for the week: the sec’s primary goal is to exercise jurisdiction over crypto markets (by any means necessary). congress hasn’t given them regulatory authority, so they’re essentially trying to coerce etf sponsors into surveilling the market for them.”as ccn previously reported, the nine etfs proposed by proshares and direxion were disapproved due to their dependence on derivatives and the bitcoin futures markets operated by the chicago board options exchange (cboe) and cme group.the two institutions revised their etf proposals to utilize us futures markets as the trusted price of the etf due to the government’s disapproval of the reliance of the winklevoss bitcoin etf on the price listed on us-based cryptocurrency exchange gemini.but, the sec emphasized that the us bitcoin futures market is not large and mature enough to allow institutions to launch etfs on top of the market.the official document released by the sec read:“[the etfs have not met the requirement that a national securities exchange’s rules be designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices. among other things, the exchange has offered no record evidence to demonstrate that bitcoin futures markets are ‘markets of significant size.”same outcomethe sec has clarified on its stance towards derivatives-based bitcoin etfs as it stated that the us futures markets are currently not big enough for etfs to based their price on futures exchanges.whether the sec revises their decision on the rejected bitcoin etfs or not, the argument of the commission on the size of the futures market is relevant and if the futures market itself does not see major improvements or growth in the short-term, derivative-based bitcoin etfs will not be approved.featured image from shutterstock.advertisement', 'few people spent 1938 feeling very playful. even while he tried, the dutch historian johan huizinga confessed that such efforts felt futile: “the fun of playing resists all analysis, all logical interpretation.” his book homo ludens approached games as an awed pilgrim, describing them in terms of myth and ritual. “there is no distinction between marking out a space for a sacred purpose and marking it out for purposes of sheer play,” huizinga wrote. “the turf, the tennis-court, the chess-board and pavement-hopscotch cannot formally be distinguished from the temple or the magic circle.” like holy liturgy, play is “pointless but significant.” huizinga made his own arrogant distinctions, arguing that “savage” societies conflate mimicry with reality—whereas europeans would never get so enthralled by ceremony. i doubt his research took him inside the nearest casino.fixated on the secrecy and mystery of games, huizinga missed their role as public spectacles: when his subjects play, there’s never any money at stake. he wanted to map out impossible territory. chess and roulette are both games, although one involves methodical skill and the other shifts fortunes on a chance bounce. you can play with a piece of chalk or a $2000 computer. none of these definitions are coherent, but they do remain useful. the philosopher ludwig wittgenstein used games as an analogy for his theory of language: we move words around following arbitrary rules, their meaning determined by our shared circumstances, trying to express the indescribable. “if a lion could speak,” he said, “we could not understand him.” imagine teaching that lion how to play poker.or picture a creature bent low against the tundra, with flesh striated like dead bark, as if even the trees were starved for prey. from snowdrifts it feeds on a corpse frozen mid-scream. the first magic: the gathering card i ever saw also came with a quotation, the last words of one saffi eriksdotter, all gothic camp: “ach! hans, run! it’s the lhurgoyf!” i didn’t know what a lhurgoyf was, and i certainly couldn’t decipher any of the symbols or rules on that card, but monsters i understood. i lingered over books full of harpies, demons, and basilisks. when other boys teased me for watching sailor moon, i would protest, not very convincingly, that the show wasn’t girly at all; it had a whole bestiary of monsters, and those belonged to everybody.as a kid i used to get myself in trouble for running onto some neighbour’s porch and exploring the terrain. by middle school i had turned into a fat, awkward dork, not bullied but rather ignored, and i resentfully shunned the world back. magic was a perfect excuse. i spent my allowance money on the lottery of booster packs; i tinkered with decks at the local game shop; i even read the awful tie-in novels, which followed the adventures of a lesser captain riker. (i do love magic’s longest-running villains, the phyrexians, an empire of techno-organic horrors stitching together the borg and the cenobites, with dialogue like: “father of machines! your filigree gaze carves us, and the scars dance upon our grateful flesh.” someone from the storyline team must realize how horny this sounds.)there was never any sudden reckoning, as the subjects of a more tangible addiction might describe. the obsession just exhausted itself. other interests caught my teenage mind, like weird art movies, or sexual confusion, or talking to strangers. for over a decade i barely thought about magic at all, so that when i started playing again last year it felt both familiar and uncanny, like returning to a house amended by generations of owners.*“the question is,” richard garfield once asked, “can systems be dramatic? can math be breathtaking? can numbers move your soul?” when your work involves things like “the distribution of the binomial coefficients modulo p” (his phd thesis), these are cosmic problems, but garfield figured out how to make aesthetics from mathematics. he comes from an unusual family; one great-great-grandfather was james garfield, the president only remembered for getting himself shot by a deranged office-seeker (before gruesomely lingering two more months as america’s finest surgeons prodded the wound). another relative invented the folding milk carton. garfield’s own father was an architect whose job took them across the world, and his lonely son noticed how people would play board games together when they had nothing else in common.the seattle games publisher peter adkison later recalled their first encounter in 1991: “then as now, [garfield] wore mismatched socks, had strange bits of thread and fabric hanging from parts of his clothing and generally looked like someone who had just walked into the salvation army and grabbed whatever seemed colourful.” still a doctoral student at the university of pennsylvania, garfield approached him with the idea for a board game called roborally, but adkison’s new company wizards of the coast had only published traditional rpgs—he feared they didn’t have the resources, and asked to see a simpler concept. garfield realized that you could use trading cards to expand and complicate a universal set of rules. back in pennsylvania he began to mock up prototypes, enlisting friends or strangers as playtesters. garfield wanted every match of magic to feel like a different experience; he thought that people would only buy one or two starter decks each year, discovering unseen cards on the other side of the table. when you read about how those earliest players spent half the time trading pieces of scrap paper, it sounds a little naïve.the cards themselves were more sophisticated: magic’s rules have hardly changed in twenty-five years. simplified here and there, rephrased, but fundamentally consistent. you still start every game with twenty life and a sixty-card library, pulling out an opening hand of seven. each turn you draw one fresh card and get to play a single land, “tapping” them for mana to cast your spells. if you run out of life, typically from creatures attacking it, you lose. instead of nation or species, garfield arranged magic’s factions into five colours, a far more abstract and elegant design. white preaches order, community, and sometimes cruel orthodoxy. blue pursues knowledge as if that can solve everything (a blue mage would definitely respond to personal essays with “citation??”). green’s nature sprites might dance you through flowers or trample you underneath elephants. red passion rouses, liberates, scorches. black admires ambition, but not scruples. wittgenstein once wrote that “i treat colour concepts like the concepts of sensations,” and garfield knew how evocative that palette could be.when magic first went on sale in 1993, the comic book speculator market was starting to collapse, a correction that eventually drove marvel comics into bankruptcy and most of north america’s specialty shops out of business. the remaining stores depended on trading cards and gaming, and magic somehow offered both. titus chalk’s recent book generation decks records how quickly it spread: “a month or two on from release, [wizards of the coast] had grown from five employees to twenty-two. by may 1994, that number had swelled to over fifty. with a recruitment policy dubbed the ‘nearest warm body’ hiring approach, the company ranks were filling with anyone wizards could get their hands on.” in seattle, a city of zine collectors with rock bands, the recruiting favoured vaguely countercultural nerds. years later, one employee described the atmosphere back then: “wizards was a big horny summer camp.”capitalism endures yet remembers nothing, so the comic book bubble only made way for a glut of new card games. there were collectible card games (ccgs) devoted to familiar genre franchises, like star wars and star trek, along with more baffling entries; for a moment in the mid-’90s, you could play games adapting the x-files or austin powers. nearly all of them went dormant long ago, leaving magic as the survivor. its generic setting turned out to be an advantage—you can’t lose the license or run out of storylines for fantasy worlds you’ve just made up. not that anyone at wizards entirely knew what they were doing: richard garfield developed arabian nights, magic’s first expansion set, without playtesting a single match. right before going to print, somebody noticed they’d forgotten to add flavour text, and the head editor wrote it all in a sleepless trance: “expect my visit when the darkness comes. the night i think is best for hiding all.” at least scheherazade had an audience.other early expansions were assigned seemingly at random: wizards art director jesper myfors handled the dark, designing outwards from its aesthetic of sinister preachers and backwoods rituals. legends got made by some garfield friends in vancouver, who created cards inspired by their dungeons & dragons characters. sales doubled with every set anyway, and wizards began to worry about hoarding. they printed 1994’s latest expansion fallen empires in the ever-growing numbers retailers demanded—350 million cards, more than twice as many as every previous set combined. you can still find sealed product lying around undisturbed at gaming stores today, like canopic jars in some egyptian tomb. the pitifully low power level didn’t help, and for a time it seemed that magic might be another collectible fad: pogs with dragons.few players understood the game yet either; the earliest tournaments often devolved into giant monsters smashing against each other. eventually people figured out that, although a craw wurm cost six mana to cast, you could kill or counter it for a fraction of those resources. a group of bay area players started testing increasingly defensive decks, focused on drawing extra cards, forcing them out of the opponent’s hand, and dealing with multiple threats at once. before long they just called it “the deck.” that definite article was not immodest; they had hit on crucial aspects of magic, which pulled competitive play between the stations of a trinity. control decks attack like a python, using card advantage to slowly exhaust all resistance. aggro decks try to force through lethal damage with maximum efficiency. combo decks win the game in a single ridiculous move, e.g. taking infinite turns, creating an unstoppable 20/20 creature, or generating huge amounts of mana. these extremes often blur together—the delver of secrets archetype resembles aggro-control, backing up a cheap threat with lots of ways to kill/disrupt things—which only makes them easier to obsess over.by 1996 the scene had matured enough that wizards of the coast decided to sponsor a circuit of professional events, which still influences tournaments down to the local shop. magic pros earn a living closer to lacrosse players than nba stars, although rotating the main format’s deckbuilding pool every year or two does sell plenty of booster packs. all of that was alien to me. i only remember staring at the cards themselves, and it doesn’t feel like mere nostalgia to say they’ve never looked better. richard garfield had always discouraged the busty-valkyrie style of fantasy art, but sue ann harkey, magic’s art director back then, came from outside the gaming world entirely; for the expansions mirage and visions, inspired by various african cultures, she recruited gallery painters and comics artists. there are many magic cards showing some kind of enormous demon, but mirage’s spirit of the night unnerves me most—it seems to melt forward from abstraction, a trick of the landscape.harkey hired illustrators who became some of the game’s most celebrated: rebecca guay, whose watercolors bring to mind stained glass; kev walker, a graduate from the chunky-grotesques school of british cartooning; terese nielsen, with her sense of serene grace. she also found artists who got swiftly dispatched after harkey left, my favourite being the voluptuously sexual figures of robert bliss. in his paintings, it is always big boy season. “rob, being the naughty chap that he is, would put penises in everything,” harkey later told the magic blogger jesse mason. “and ever since [a particularly well-disguised one on the card polymorph], everyone looked for penises… and then i couldn’t commission him any more.” there’s magic art i love from recent years—guay’s bitterblossom must be one of the most beautiful things ever printed on a piece of cardboard—but the reigning style is bland competence, like illustrations marketing some lavishly expensive video game, almost flaunting their conservatism.*in 2012, richard garfield published a book called characteristics of games, describing his medium with the structural analysis that roland barthes brought to narrative. to play is to wander an “impossible idea,” he wrote: “a game must keep hope alive for a reversal of fortune, even while reassuring players that everything they do has a place in a fixed progression.” characteristics of games can be surprisingly funny, albeit with a mathematician’s sense of humour—during one aside garfield notes that “taste is not commonly a factor in games, except perhaps in sports if things go drastically wrong”—and it sometimes sounds existential about that tension between human caprice and grand designs. “aesthetic appeal and support of gameplay can work against each other,” garfield argues. “aesthetic considerations often push for a greater ornateness, and gameplay wants simplicity of interface … thus in some sense artists and game designers are natural enemies.”garfield created magic: the gathering, but he left wizards of the coast two decades ago after hasbro bought the company. the game’s dominant figure over all those years has been mark rosewater, a former screenwriter, not a professor; he likes to joke about his old roseanne credits. rosewater prefers the language of genre tropes to mathematic systems. he has written that his goal is to entertain players while meeting their expectations, not unlike a hollywood producer running some cinematic universe. rosewater’s official title is head designer, but he also serves as magic’s media face, marketing pitchman, and court historian. imagine if chess were owned by a single company, and the same person creating new boards chronicled the game’s past while telling everyone how great chess was. and because that company promised not to reproduce many older, powerful chess pieces out of deference to collectors, certain formats only really get played online, the one place where enough people can afford it. magic is both performance and commodity, a pas de deux maneuvering around display cases.perhaps rosewater had that contradiction in mind when he called the widest upheaval of his tenure “new world order,” although his ambitions fell short of a planet ruled by liberal capitalism. the idea was to simplify more common cards, especially for booster draft (where you take picks one by one, like a sports draft, and then build your miniature deck). much as i love looking at complicated magic boards, those don’t always reveal good design—players might have to study a dozen overlapping effects, few of them immediately meaningful. several of the most popular draft formats were developed following new world order guidelines, including the consensus favourite, 2011’s horror-inspired innistrad. so many cards from that set feel deceptively complex, serving different roles depending on your plan; one deck used a bunch of thirteenth picks to dump its entire library into the graveyard zone, food for an army of spiders. to evoke transformations at dusk, rosewater created double-sided cards, which can shift from human to monster. no other theme has shaped his designs so neatly.dominaria, the latest magic set, returned to the game’s home plane for the first time since 2006, with garfield making guest contributions. it’s the most open-ended expansion in years, even after they restrained his stranger ideas—like the sagas, a new card type meant to represent living mythology. yet the designs still feel safer than future sight, our previous visit to dominaria. that set used nostalgia as an excuse to combine dozens of mechanics, some long gone and others only envisioned, with startling effect. one card does nothing outside of the graveyard. another can counter your opponent’s spell for free, or rather in advance; if you don’t pay its mana cost on your next turn, you lose the game. future sight approached history like a revisionist, fracturing accepted notions of how magic should play. dominaria presents a timeline of ancient relics and legendary heroes, expecting their due reverence.the new world order era coincided with magic’s audience growing exponentially, an imperial phase now tailing off. around the middle of the last century, french sociologist roger caillois critiqued johan huizinga’s idealized definition of play in homo ludens: “it is true that the kinds of games are almost infinitely varied, but the constant relationship between chance and profit is very striking … in certain of its manifestations, play is designed to be lucrative or ruinous.” caillois never imagined how deep that relationship might run, arguing that, although a casino mogul extracts money from each gambler (“the entrepreneur alone does not play”), play itself creates no wealth or material goods. he could not foresee the esports industry, which generates hundreds of millions of dollars from people watching other people play video games. magic puts up similar numbers in paper form, but it lags behind its younger digital cousins online. hearthstone usually ranks among the top five games of any genre by streaming viewership; magic scrapes to #30 on a good month.in the characteristics of games, richard garfield mentions an early example of play turning self-conscious, from edo-period japan: “the annual go games played before the shogun were eventually played out entirely in advance, the players sequestered to prevent knowledge of the results from leaking out, and then the games replayed for the shogun, all to prevent them from lasting too long for the spectators.” how simple can you make a game with 15,000 unique cards? magic online remains ugly to watch partly because it needs to handle every possible interaction—and many famous decks hinge on exploiting those intricacies. people like to say they’re playing “as garfield intended,” the joke being that the designer always wanted his creation to mutate out of control. garfield once wrote that his own favourite magic card is shahrazad, from the arabian nights expansion, which starts a new game within the game. it’s also one of the very few spells to get banned in every competitive format, since clever mages can cast it over and over until time loses all meaning.coveting the esports market, wizards has developed a flashier program called magic: the gathering arena, limited to recent sets; given the design mistakes defying rosewaterist orthodoxy, with more cards banned over the past year than the previous decade, that pitch may not be so enticing. i haunt magic online in spite of its looks. when i first returned to the game, i’d spent a month homeless, crashing on couches. my days were featureless blanks contorted by anxiety. every inscrutable aspect of magic fascinated me: i loved how improvised booster draft feels, as alliances form and dissolve. it balances chess’s chilly purity with the social theatre of poker. when i mentioned this piece to my friend michael deforge, a cartoonist and part-time mage, he wrote back: “i like that magic is always a puzzle. the deck building is a puzzle, your draft choices are a puzzle, and each game is a puzzle. even deciding what hands to keep.”at the height of world war ii, the mathematician john von neumann framed economics as a conflict between rational individuals, establishing the field of game theory. that would prove less convincing than his models for the first nuclear bomb. von neumann once argued that chess is not a game at all, because one player can always theoretically force a tie (mutual assured destruction). the precise series of moves involved remains a mystery, too vast for our computers to calculate, not that that offers weaker players any hope. in the characteristics of games, garfield estimates the odds that a chess amateur will prevail against a grandmaster—they’re also the chances of winning the new york lottery seven times straight. but magic’s rules allow for randomness, the harlequin behind every card. novices sometimes bring down hall-of-famers. nineteenth-century gamblers would seek guidance from dream books, which fastened surreal images to each play, like a soothsayer. they shared as we do an ancient fantasy, to sense the fates losing grasp of your thread.', 'atty. alex moss: >>>according to the court, the

coinmarketcapmid-week, the markets saw a similar tumble to the one that came in response to july’s news that the winklevoss twins’ high-profile btc etf proposal had also been rejected by the sec, which then saw a comparable $12 billion wiped from total market capitalization.the tumble has nonetheless proved to temporary in the immediate-short term. as crypto analyst brian kelly argued on cnbc this week, the fact that the “market didn’t sell off” on news of the most recent etf denials is a bullish sign of “sentiment change” that suggests many nonetheless expect we are coming “incrementally closer” to eventual etf approval.this has been reinforced by news that the sec plans to review its fresh spate of etf rejections, as well as voices within the agency — notably sec commissioner hester m. peirce — who have officially dissented from the regulator’s prior btc-related etf rejections.', 'it’s been an interesting couple of days for a number of exchanges which were hoping to get the green light to launch various bitcoin exchange-traded funds (etfs).on aug. 22, the u.s. securities and exchange commission (sec) released its verdict on nine separate etfs submitted by three applicants, proshares, direxion and graniteshares.the move denied the trio permission to move ahead with plans to launch their respective products. proshares was looking to launch a pair of bitcoin etfs, direxion had sought approval for five products while graniteshares hoped to launch two offerings of their own.however, the sec made a u-turn on that original finding on august 23, putting out a statement that it would review its decision of all nine etfs.the regulator has not released a deadline for its review, but it means that these applicants may still be able to forge ahead with their etfs.fears of fraudulent behavior, price manipulationthe sec provided the same grounds for rejection for each of the various etfs. the main concern seems to be that the companies are not meeting the requirements to “prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices.”furthermore, the regulatory body raised concerns about the size of the bitcoin etf market. considering that it is a very small domain, there is unease that the exchanges won’t be able to ensure that there is no market manipulation.“among other things, the exchange has offered no record evidence to demonstrate that bitcoin futures markets are ‘markets of significant size.’ that failure is critical because <...> the exchange has failed to establish that other means to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices will be sufficient, and therefore surveillance-sharing with a regulated market of significant size related to bitcoin is necessary.”it’s also important to note that the sec made it clear that its original decision was in no way influenced by — or a reflection on — the value and use cases of bitcoin and blockchain technology.\"[the agency] emphasizes that its disapproval does not rest on an evaluation of whether bitcoin, or blockchain technology more generally, has utility or value as an innovation or an investment.\"not all doom and gloomcointelegraph reached out to anthony pompliano, founder and partner at morgan creek digital assets, who addressed the topic in his off the chain newsletter this week.pompliano highlighted the main takeaways from the sec’s judgement, which seems to have been fair, while also maintaining their focus on ensuring the safety of investors.the etfs in question differ somewhat from other offerings that have also been denied by the sec. these nine etfs are ‘derivative-backed,’ meaning the exchanges own futures contracts and not actual bitcoin.while the sec will now review its latest rejection, pompliano believes that the crypto industry will only see the launch of bitcoin etfs in 2019:“the crypto industry will eventually get retail products approved by the sec. the proper infrastructure and controls need to be in place first. this work will include implementing qualified custodianship, while preventing market manipulation. it is unlikely that regulators will be satisfied with any anti-market manipulation measures created during the remainder of this year. this would push the first etf approval until 2019.”as pompliano suggests, there seems to be an infatuation with bitcoin etfs and the possibility of their issuance bringing better market sentiment for the cryptocurrency. however, these financial instruments could also have a negative effect on the stability of bitcoin’s value, as pompliano noted:“in fact, an argument could be made that an etf would simply give more people the opportunity to short bitcoin, which would drive the price lower. although this would be highly unlikely, we did see a significant increase in downward price pressures in the market with the introduction of bitcoin futures roughly nine months ago. we’re living in an unpredictable market, so anything is possible.”cointelegraph also reached out to cornell university associate professor emin gün sirer, who had positive remarks in the wake of the sec’s decision:“the reasoning by the sec is absolutely fair. the good news is that they are not saying anything negative about crypto as an asset class. in fact, they seem predisposed to accept it in the same category as every other asset, and they are applying the exact same standards as everything else. the problems they cite are not with the asset, but with the ecosystem that has been built around it.”gün sirer believes that the main stumbling block lies at cryptocurrency exchanges, which are still plagued by problems like fraud and a lack of regulatory frameworks:“the crypto community keeps hoping for a miracle, where the sec suddenly has a lapse in judgment and reverses decades of its own practice, and keeps getting disappointed as a result. the sec is patiently citing a small number of issues, all related to malfeasance or misbehavior at the exchanges. the crypto community has to learn to demand better, and evolve the ecosystem toward a higher standard.”until that happens, the cornell university professor believes the sec will continue to deny the approval of other etfs.crypto analyst brian kelly reacted to the news positively in a segment on the cnbc fast money show, suggesting that the latest move points to an eventual approval of bitcoin etfs in february 2019. the barriers to entry, in his view, is the sec’s ability to keep a close eye on trading and to identify fraud and manipulation.furthermore, kelly says that the sec believes that the bitcoin futures markets are not yet mature — having only been around since december 2017:“i think we’re incrementally closer to getting an etf and a very positive thing was that bitcoin didn’t sell-off. when a market, whether its bitcoin or oil, doesn’t sell-off on the news that it should, that means there’s a sentiment change.”waves of changewhile it’s unclear when the sec will release a finding on the review of its decision on the latest etfs, there is a lot to look forward to in september.the sec will deliver a ruling on direxion’s proposed etf on sept. 21, while the deadline for another bitcoin etf proposed by financial services company solidx and investment firm vaneck has been pushed back to sept. 30.it seems that the sec is trying to give itself more time to make well-educated decisions when it comes to new exchange-traded products. this follows their announcement in july which denied the winklevoss twins’ second application to launch a bitcoin etf.the ruling had a big effect on the cryptocurrency markets, as values dropped across the board following the decision.sec commissioner hester peirce has been a staunch proponent of the approval of bitcoin-backed etfs. when the regulatory body denied the winklevoss twins’ bitcoin etf for a second time, she publically dissented from the ruling.in her statement, peirce said the very creation of bitcoin-related, exchange-traded products (etp) would allow mainstream and institutional investors to gain exposure to the cryptocurrency in a regulated and more sheltered environment:“an etp based on bitcoin would offer investors indirect exposure to bitcoin through a product that trades on a regulated securities market and in a manner that eliminates some of the frictions and worries of buying and holding bitcoin directly. if we were to approve the etp at issue here, investors could choose whether to buy it or avoid it.”sec trying to get it rightwhile it seems like the sec has taken a hard stance against exchanges applying to launch bitcoin etfs, it is worth taking a step back and looking at their overarching rhetoric on the topic.this latest decision to review the findings of its own staff suggests that the regulatory body is performing a bit of a juggling act.as sec ceo jay clayton said in february, the organization would like to create an environment that encourages growth in the space while protecting investors from fraudulent practices and scams:“simply said, we should embrace the pursuit of technological advancement, as well as new and innovative techniques for capital raising, but not at the expense of the principles undermining our well-founded and proven approach to protecting investors and markets.”thus the very issues that the sec is trying to address could well be answered through the use of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology.conventional exchanges are kept in check by auditors and legal entities, which ensure that markets are protected from irregular or fraudulent behavior of exchanges. this is where gün sirer thinks blockchain tech and cryptocurrencies could revolutionize the space:“crypto assets are special and different. its possible for us to implement technical measures that can prohibit such malfeasance by construction. that is, crypto has the opportunity to not only meet, but exceed the standard to which the sec holds wall street. we can lead the world here and lead every other asset class through judicious and careful use of technology, and facilitate the tokenization of conventional assets in the process. of course, this requires a switch away from blind speculation in rigged markets, toward better technological developments. the sooner the crypto community gets behind a unified push to clean up exchanges and implement better, high-assurance decentralized exchanges, the sooner sec-approved etfs will become a reality.”market volatilitythe sec’s announcement that it would review its initial finding had a notable effect on the cryptocurrency markets, with bitcoin rebounding after an slight pull-back following the original rejection on august 22.it marks a week of volatility, which was also influenced by china’s latest crackdown on cryptocurrency-related events in certain parts of beijing. bitcoin was trading at around $6,790 at the time of publishing.bitcoin 7-day price chart. source: cointelegraph bitcoin price index', 'advertisementbitcoin advocate andreas antonopoulos offered his opinion on bitcoin etfs in a rather foreboding video released on august 14.he first explained the concept of an etf or exchange-traded fund as a fund that has a custodian or manager that creates a special financial instrument that is similar to a stock. in the case of bitcoin etfs the instrument is a fund that holds bitcoin and sells shares in a bitcoin reserve that represents the price of bitcoin as a stock that can be traded through regular brokerage accounts on the stock market.the custodian holds the actual bitcoin and the customer buys a share in the funds without having to navigate the often rigorous and complex process of registering for cryptocurrency exchanges, completing kyc, and familiarizing themselves with encrypted keys and wallets.the cryptocurrency space has lauded the inevitable arrival of etfs as a crucial event that will greatly increase the market cap of cryptocurrency and essentially save cryptocurrency investors and traders from the current bear market, taking cryptocurrency to the next level as a financial market. in his video antonopoulos outlined in no uncertain terms what he sees as the dangers of bitcoin etfs, citing the market manipulation that took over the price action of gold as an example.“i’m going to burst your bubble. i know a lot of people want to see bitcoin etfs because ‘lambos’ and ‘to the moon’ and all that. i think it’s a terrible idea. i still think it’s going to happen, but i think it’s a terrible idea. i’m actually against bitcoin etfs.”apart from the potential of increased market manipulation by major market makers as is seen in the commodities markets, antonopoulos is concerned over the issue of consensus.bitcoin holders essentially have the right to vote on certain issues based on which exchanges they choose to trust their coins with, which fork they support, etc.“if there is ever a fork debate, which is very likely to happen again in any cryptocurrency, then the fund that controls that bitcoin now has a very large voice. their shareholders don’t. they don’t get to choose which fork the fund is going to follow in a bitcoin debate… we already saw that level of influence during the august 1st fork, user activated software forks, bitcoin cash, the scaling debate… large custodial exchanges had a very strong voice in the ecosystem. they were able to decide if they were going to support or not on behalf of 10 million customers… an etf will do that and it will do that on an even bigger scale”centralized fund managers having millions of votes in the bitcoin ecosystem allowing for manipulation in price action, scaling debates, and forks is the main concern for the antonopoulous who foresees disagreements over forks between major etfs leading to splits forming currencies akin to “corporate bitcoin.”in a situation where authorities are pressuring the community to make bitcoin less private and more transparent, it could be the case that an etf would feel obliged to comply with the regulatory pressure and refuse to adopt privacy measures, creating a separate, corporate bitcoin market.the prominent bitcoin advocate’s views were mirrored by former wall street executive caitlin long in a ccn interview in which she denounced the involvement of wall street financialization in the crypto space due to the bad practices it would inevitably bring.featured image from wikimedia.advertisement', 'when talking about e-commerce, investors often focus on amazon.com (nasdaq:amzn), the 800-pound gorilla of the market, and the industries its disrupting with its ever-expanding ecosystem.however, they shouldnt ignore three other high-growth companies that are changing how companies do business over the internet: shopify (nyse:shop), square (nyse:sq), and grubhub (nyse:grub). all three stocks have generated multibagger returns over the past three years, and they could soar even higher on some long-term tailwinds.1. shopifyshopify assists companies in designing, setting up, and running online stores. it helps them process orders, payments, and shipments; launch marketing campaigns; build online customer relationships; and measure their overall performance with cloud-based analytics. simply put, its a one-stop shop for building a companys e-commerce presence.new features like payments platform shopify pay, a point-of-sale (pos) card reader, a wholesale channel for buyers, bulk label printing options, and apis (application programming interfaces) for integrating its platform into third-party apps have expanded its ecosystem. shopify also offers merchants cash advances through its financial arm, shopify capital.revenue rose 62% year over year last quarter, as subscription solutions and merchant solutions revenue soared 55% and 68%, respectively. shopify expects its full-year sales to grow 51% to 53%, compared to 73% growth in 2017. the company isnt profitable on a gaap basis, but its been profitable on a non-gaap basis for the past four quarters.2. squaresquare disrupted the market for traditional pos systems with the square reader card-reading dongle for smartphones, the square stand pos solution for ipads, and the stand-alone square register. it then tethered its merchants to an expanding ecosystem of cloud-based services for managing payroll, inventory, customer relationships, deliveries, shopping data, and website designs. it even loans money to merchants through its financial unit, square capital.the company also owns the food delivery app caviar, which it recently integrated into its unified square for restaurants bundle of services for booking tables and managing payments. for consumers, it offers square cash, one of the most popular mobile p2p (peer-to-peer) payment apps in the u.s. square cash is also the only major p2p payments player that lets its users buy and sell bitcoin.squares revenue surged 48% annually last quarter. on an adjusted basis, which excludes transaction-based costs, bitcoin costs, and deferred revenue adjustments, revenue climbed 60%. squares total transaction-based revenue and gross payment volumes both grew 30%. square still isnt profitable on a gaap basis, but its non-gaap earnings surged 86% last quarter. looking ahead, it expects its adjusted revenue to jump 54%-57% for the year and for its adjusted earnings to go up 56%-70%.3. grubhubgrubhub owns the top online food delivery platform in america. its portfolio of services -- which include its namesake app, seamless, eat24, menupages, allmenus, diningin, and other apps -- controls about half of the u.s. food delivery market, according to second measures march estimates. its closest rivals, uber eats and doordash, controlled 21% and 15% of the market, respectively.not only does grubhub continually scale up by acquiring smaller rivals, but its also building an ecosystem atop its high-growth niche. the company recently acquired levelup, a payments and loyalty services provider, which could help it counter square for restaurants and cross-sell more services to its growing list of restaurant partners.revenue surged 51% last quarter, thanks to grubhubs acquisition of eat24, 35% growth in daily average grubs (orders), 39% growth in gross food sales, and a 70% jump in active diners.unlike shopify and square, grubhub is consistently profitable by both gaap and non-gaap measures. last quarter, its non-gaap net income rose 99% year over year, gaap earnings more than doubled, and adjusted ebitda grew 61%. wall street expects grubhubs revenue and non-gaap earnings to grow 44% and 59%, respectively, this year.high risks and high rewardsshopify, square, and grubhub generate a lot of growth, but all three stocks have lofty valuations. shopify trades at over 230 times forward (2019) earnings, square at almost 100 times forward earnings, and grubhub trades for nearly 60 times forward earnings. those valuations are based on non-gaap figures -- they would be even higher if gaap figures were used.therefore, these stocks definitely shouldnt be core holdings for most investors. however, investors looking for riskier investment opportunities with potentially high returns should take a closer look at these high-growth digital retail plays.', 'bitcoin price bitcoin at $60k matter of ‘when,’ not

consisting of adoption and hence improved price performance — a number of macro factors needed to line up for bitcoin to have its shot. specifically, emerging markets should rally for btc/usd to do the same, as bitcoin’s 2017 all-time highs and subsequent cool-off coincided with similar behavior on the msci emerging markets index versus the s&p 500.the links between the two, he told cnbc, were hedge funds and wealth effect.“hedge funds typically rent emerging market stocks, so they’re risk-on, risk-off… when they’re risk-off, bitcoin also suffers because they’re risk-off,” he explained.…if you’re living in an emerging market and you see your stock market fall hugely, that means you’ve got a lot less money to buy bitcoin, so that affects the network effect.going forward, lee stuck with

gpu render (1225) 26:48 5:02where to buythe wx 9100 is a high-end professional workstation card that supports ecc memory is intended for large computing jobs or a high volume of them in a zero-fault environment.to support this goal, the wx 9100 comes with 16gb of hbm2 memory, 4096 stream processors and is based on amds latest 12nm vega architecture. for outputs, the card has six mini-displayport 1.4 connections supporting 10-bit output.all of these features add to a graphics card costing $1500 which will definitely seem high for the consumer market, now that the bitcoin squeeze on pricing is over. but, to those needing that kind of computational heft, its not a bad buy even when you add the egpu enclosure.well be comparing the wx 9100 and sonnet combo to the best graphics card available in our 2018 15-inch i9 macbook pro , the 4gb radeon pro 560x. well also be connecting that machine to the amd 580 pro blackmagic egpu which houses a radeon pro 580 graphics chip with 8gb of memory.we used the set-egpu script to force all applications to use the egpu, but this shouldnt be required with macos mojave.starting off with geekbench 4s opencl test, the wx 9100 scored more than double that of our macbooks internal graphics and a bit higher than blackmagics unit.doing a quick benchmark run in unigines heaven benchmark which tests gaming graphics performance, the wx 9100 once again performs more than twice as good as the 560x and about 45% faster than the blackmagic egpu.moving on to video editing tasks, we first ran the bruce x benchmark for final cut pro which mostly taxes the graphics cards.running the final cut x stabilization filter on a 20-second 4k video clip, the wx 9100 egpu performed the task in just 7 seconds, compared to 13 with both the integrated 560x and blackmagics egpu.in davinci resolve, this task went from 28 seconds to 17 seconds with black magics egpu and then to 14 seconds.we do video editing tasks daily, obviously —a task that many are looking to improve with an egpu. starting with rendering a 5 minute 4k project using standard h.264 footage with color correction and effects, we didnt see any improvement in final cut x, with the blackmagic egpu actually slowing it down.we suspect that the highest-end graphics available in the 2018 15-inch macbook pro is already fast enough at rendering this footage with effects to the point that cpu isnt limited. on top of that, there is some bandwidth constraints made worse by having to send the data through thunderbolt 3 not only to the gpu to be rendered, but also back to our software.as we move on to much tougher codecs like canon cinema raw lite where internal graphics are a huge bottleneck, we see some major improvement even with a short one-minute timeline. not only did our render go from almost four times longer than the project itself to less than half that time, but our timeline performance went from and unusable 20 frames per second, to 55 frames per second which is a massive improvement.in davinci resolve, we went from 20 minutes with the internal 560x, to 15 minutes with the blackmagic egpu, and just 8 minutes with the wx 9100.taking a look at a 1 minute 4.5k red raw project with color correction and effects, we dont see much change in final cut pro because our cpu is the bottleneck. davinci resolve uses the graphics cards more so we see about 60 percent faster speeds with the wx 9100.applying noise reduction is often needed with raw footage, and it usually makes anything but the highest end computers like a higher spec imac pro choke. with temporal noise reduction added in resolve, our wx 9100 finished the job in nearly one-third of the time than the 560x and the timeline had very few dropped frames making it workable where the macbook wasnt.to finish off this first round of testing, we used blender to test the 3d rendering capabilities of the radeon pro wx 9100 vs the internal radeon pro 560x. we used the 1225 bmw test project available on blenders website and used the graphics cards to render. here, the wx 9100 completed the task at just 5 minutes vs close to 27 minutes on the macbook pro alone.in conclusion, the wx 9100 is a very powerful card that can greatly speed some professional tasks. on top of that, tasks that require dual precision gpus and ecc memory are now possible, without purchasing a dedicated workstation computer capable of this.we at appleinsider are very excited about the possibilities that egpus offer and are looking forward to even better support in macos mojave.amds radeon pro wx 9100 graphics card is currently available from third-party sellers on amazon for $1,449.99 . b&h also has the video card in stock for $1,499.99 with free expedited shipping and no tax collected outside new york and

by about $600 billion, or 75 percent, since the peak in january, according to data from the website coinmarketcap.com.the virtual currency markets have been through booms and busts before \\x97 and recovered to boom again. but this bust could have a more lasting impact on the technologys adoption because of the sheer number of ordinary people who invested in digital tokens over the last year, and who are likely to associate cryptocurrencies with financial ruin for a very long time.(excerpt) read more at cnbc.com ...topics:business/economycubagermanyrussiaunited

company alphabet, she went to the office, grabbed her employee badge, and ran right back out to the airport for a trip to iraq to interview terrorists.she was thrilled.\"i spent one week in kurdistan interviewing isis defectors: former isis fighters who went to the caliphate to become suicide bombers,\" she told business insider.during that time, she and the other alphabet staffers on her new team learned how and why the defectors initially became radicalized and the role technology played in recruiting them.it was exactly the kind of work georgiou dreamed of doing when she applied to google in 2016, braving its infamous battery of job interviews to land a spot as business development & strategic partnerships at jigsaw — the not-so-well-known team of security specialists at alphabet, with a big, ambitious mission: ensuring that technology is used for good.fighting terroristsgeorgiou is an international law and business expert who speaks five languages, including arabic and armenian, and has lived all over the world.reuters/zohra bensemra she first became aware of jigsaw after it was born in 2010 as google ideas, under founder jared cohen.cohen is a counter-terrorism expert who worked under both condoleezza rice and hillary clinton. he came to google as the tech giant began to realize that the internet was a double-edged sword, just as capable of helping spread information as it was of enabling bad people to do bad things.the group was originally trying to counter the rising wave of terrorists using social media and the web to radicalize people.jigsaws work has since expanded to counter other misuse of the web, such as booting internet trolls from web forums. it is also working to protect news or political websites from distributed denial of service (ddos) attacks — a common technique where bad guys make a website inaccessible by overloading it with fake web traffic.the redirect methodthat first week on the job, when she flew to iraq for her interviews, was \"fascinating,\" georgiou describes, but it was \"also really useful\" to talk to people who were recruited in that way.\"thanks to these insights, weve developed something called the redirect method,\" she says, now used by organizations across the globe.rather than just removing that recruitment content, jigsaws method advises education. anyone searching for that content is shown videos and ads that debunk the propaganda, instead.this method is really important, she says, because of how many young people were getting drawn in by promises of honor and glory if they left their existing life behind and joined the fight.\"you think of an isis terrorist as this old guy. but they were all like 20-21, they were kids,\" she says referring to the people she interviewed.\"they really thought they were going to muslim disneyland.\"they were promised a \"perfect religious world,\" but \"instead they wind up in this place of war and terror and dictatorship where they take away your phone and burn your passport and you cant even leave if you want to and you are tortured or you have to kill people,\" she says.that research taught the jigsaw team that the most powerful way to combat radicalism wasnt to remove content, but to help would-be terrorists get a sense of the reality of what theyre signing up for.trolls and conspiraciesfor google, a lot of the problems that jigsaw is tackling hit close to home. its youtube service, for instance, has come under broad criticism for how its algorithm can surface misinformation and conspiracy theories, in its endless and automated quest to show you more of what it thinks youll be interested in. it also means that someone who watches one conspiracy theory video will be served up way more of them, deepening the viewer inside an insular echo chamber.those seeking moon landing conspiracy theory videos on youtube are shown factual videos. youtube but youtube has taken advantage of jigsaws redirect method to fight these effects.it has begun to surround so-called misinformation and conspiracy videos with links and context in the hopes to inform the viewer, it said in july.some have argued that these tactics arent enough and that youtube needs to do more to outright ban these people from its platform — much like it eventually banned conspiracy theorist alex jones earlier this month after days of controversy.but georgiou is encouraged by youtubes work to defend against misuse, she says, and by the investment alphabet is making in jigsaw. its crew has grown from six people when she joined, to about 60 today.\"obviously, its not an easy problem to solve because on youtube alone there are 300 hours of videos that are uploaded every minute, and hundreds of millions of comments uploaded to facebook and twitter every minute,\" she said. \"even if you hired the entire humanity to review every single thing on the internet there would not be enough.\"but, she says, she believes the internet companies really are taking their role seriously. \"there are a lot of different initiatives being done in this area,\" she says.for instance, theres an industry effort called the global internet forum to counter terrorism, which includes youtube, facebook, microsoft, twitter and others. and there are other efforts, like share the facts, which helps fact-checkers work and share their results across the internet and is used by google news.', 'advertisementin the past 24 hours, the bitcoin price has increased from $6,400 to $6,700, recording a decent increase in its daily volume.the valuation of the crypto market has increased from $210 billion to $215 billion within a two-day period, fueled by the short-term surge in the price of tokens.ethereum-based tokens like wanchain, aion, and icon recorded solid gains in the range of 10 to 20 percent against both the us dollar and bitcoin, showing some momentum against major cryptocurrencies.ethereum, ripple, bitcoin cash, and eos, the top five cryptocurrencies in the global market, have struggled to demonstrate a recovery in their volume and price, closing the day with mere 0.3 to 1 percent gains, falling behind bitcoin and the rest of the market.bitcoin dominance still strongin previous reports, ccn noted that the dominance index of btc, which measures the dominance of the cryptocurrency over the global market, is an important metric to measure the short-term growth and momentum of tokens and small market cap cryptocurrencies.in the past seven days, the dominance index of btc has increased from 51 percent to 53.6 percent, despite the recovery in the price of btc.under normal circumstances, tokens tend to demonstrate 10 to 20 percent gains if btc rises by 3 to 5 percent in value, as investors become more confident in investing in high-risk and high-return trades. however, this week, tokens have not been able to record large movements on the upside.bitcoin’s strong dominance over the market suggests that investors are thoroughly convinced that the corrective rally from $6,200 to $6,700 has established a platform for the rest of the market to continue a short-term rally over the upcoming weeks.while many analysts have suggested that the momentum of bitcoin will likely enable the dominant cryptocurrency to surpass the $7,000 mark, it may take bitcoin to break out of the $7,000 resistance level for tokens to see a rapid increase in value in the short-term.throughout the past few months, btchas declined by more than 30 percent, from the $9,000 region to mid-$6,000. tokens have fallen 60 to 70 percent against bitcoin, recording 95 percent losses against the us dollar.over the past 12 hours, 10 percent of bitcoin short contracts on bitfinex, the biggest margin trading platform in the cryptocurrency market, have been closed, suggesting that bears are not confident in betting against the newly found momentum of bitcoin.as such, it is more likely for bitcoin to test the $7,000 mark in the next few days, rather than dropping back to the lower end of the $6,000 region.bear market is not over, but good to accumulateerik voorhees, the ceo of shapeshift, one of the most popular peer-to-peer digital asset exchanges in the market, has said that the bear market is not over for crypto but it is a good time to accumulate given the low price range of most cryptocurrencies.most investors still expect the price of bitcoin to endure one last minor correction before initiating a mid-term rally but the general sentiment around the crypto market remains positive.featured image from shutterstock. charts

target by december. but, other permabulls are not as optimistic as lee about the short-term trend of bitcoin.in may, bitmex ceo arthur hayes stated that he would like to see the btc price fall to the $5,000 region before recovering and initiating a 2017-esqe rally to ensure that the market does not expose itself to the creation of a minor bubble.this week, shapeshift ceo erik voorhees and cryptocurrency investor anthony pompliano, better known as pomp, echoed the sentiment of hayes, stating that the bear market of bitcoin is not over just yet.$5,000 before $10,000on cnbc crypto trader, hosted by ran neuner, voorhees, the founder and ceo of major digital asset trading platform shapeshift, said:“i don’t expect it (bear market) to end soon, although i do think that the rate of collapse has slowed considerably. generally in these bubbles, after you go through several months of a downtrend you hang out in a range for a while… but i think we are done with a majority of the collapse.”voorhees offered a relatively enthusiastic viewpoint on the trend of the crypto market, noting that while the bear market of bitcoin has evidently not ended, the worst part of the correction has slowed down.last week, researchers at diar reported that the rate of bitcoin’s volatility has dropped to a 14-month low, as btc demonstrated stability in the mid-$6,000 range since august 6, for around three weeks.as seen in previous 80 percent corrections and rallies in 2012, 2014, and 2017, bitcoin has traditionally required a period of stability before initiating a large rally on the upside.hence, the btc price demonstrating stability in the range of $6,300 to $6,700 over the past three weeks is positive, but the dominant cryptocurrency will need to show months of stability before establishing a strong foundation to support its next big rally.however, pomp has not been as optimistic as voorhees and hayes, as he wrote in his latest newsletter that he sees the price of btc falling to the $3,000 region before recovering to the $10,000 resistance level.“the final data outputs left me with a few uncomfortable conclusions. the most notable one is that we are likely to see bitcoin near $3,000 before we see bitcoin at $10,000 again. if this is true, that means we still have ~50 percent price decrease to go. things may get really, really ugly if this happens,” pomp noted.what happens to bitcoin in december?some analysts see bitcoin falling to $5,000, $4,000, and even $3,000 before recovering. but, most of the analysts share the sentiment that bitcoin will rebound to major resistance levels in the $10,000 to $15,000 range by the end of december.predictions of most experts and analysts in the cryptocurrency space change on a regular basis, as it is difficult to speculate the exact region btc will fall to and recover from. it is important for investors to look at the mid-term trend of bitcoin, analyzing actual metrics like volume and market demand to foresee the future trend of bitcoin.featured image from shutterstockadvertisement', 'bitcoin bitcoin price defies sec etf rejection – sign of a maturing market?bitcoin price appears to be little affected by negative news coming out from the sec concerning the possibility of a bitcoin etf.multiple etf rejections not enough to trigger bitcoin selloffsnegative news coming out one minute and btc price 00 taking a tumble the next minute. this was one of the more consistent occurrences in a seemingly unpredictable bitcoin market. everything from exchange hacks to government bans, and coinmarketcap would be dripping red.in recent times, this particular dynamic seems to have changed significantly. a few days ago, the sec denied three btc etf filings and the price of the cryptocurrency barely registered a blip. compare this with the winklevoss etf rejection and the vaneck/solidx etf delay that sent btc price into a tailspin.the sluggish price can be directly tied to the sec bitcoin etf decisions. optimistism and hope that an sec-approved etf would significantly boost btc price culminated in btc reaching $8,400 in late july.market resilience: bear-fatigue or maturing marketas with other occurrences in the market, knowing the reason for an emerging trend is of some importance. the present consensus lies somewhere between “bear-fatigue” and “market maturity” though either might be a bit premature.according to tim enneking, the managing director of crypto asset management, the market has matured to a level where obvious news like the sec btc etf rejection is to be expected. commenting on the matter, enneking said:after the most recent winklevoss rejection, virtually no one expected any of these applications to be approved.brian kelly of bkcm llc has on many occasions predicted that an sec-approved bitcoin etf in 2018 was highly unlikely. for blockforce ceo, eric ervin, the vaneck/solidx etf stands the best chance of receiving the commission’s approval.speaking to forbes, ervin expressed his belief that the market is robust enough to continue is growth and development even as more institutional investors enter the matter.it hasn’t only been doom and gloom for bitcoin and the cryptocurrency market in general over the past two months. in august, intercontinental exchange announced the launch of bakkt, a proposed digital

navy acquires 15 warships in 7 months“, which was originally released by southfront on july 19, 2018:while there was much fanfare and attention given to the july 3rd launch of two type 055 guided missile destroyers at the dalian shipbuilding industry co. (disc) shipyard in dalian, very little mention has been made of the many other warships that the plan has launched or commissioned since the beginning of the year. although the type 055 ddg is the plan’s most powerful surface combatant, and the largest such vessel constructed by an asian nation since world war ii, they are one component in a steadily growing naval force structure. while the addition of three type 055 ddgs this year, added to the first vessel in class which rolled into the water from dalian just over a year ago in june of 2017, showcase china’s growing capabilities not only in producing powerful and modern warships, they also illustrate the maturity and stunning capacity of the chinese ship building industry. this industry has launched and/or commissioned 15 modern warships in just the first seven months of 2018.three more type 055 destroyersthis year is proving to be a big year for the plan. of the fifteen vessels built so far in 2018, three have been the newest and most powerful surface warfare vessel in the chinese arsenal, the type 055 ddg. the world was stunned when china was able to complete the first of this new class in june of 2017. sections of a second in this class were clearly visible in satellite imagery at the time. that vessel was launched in may of this year, but two more type 055 destroyers were launched simultaneously on july 3rd, just two months later. the 5th and 6th vessels in class are already in varying stages of construction.although initial reports had suggested that a total of six vessels had been ordered, it has been hinted that this number has been increased to eight. this number will most likely grow to at least 12 vessels by 2025, when the plan will be looking to expand its aircraft carrier program with the introduction of at least one carrier of the type 002 class. it has yet to be determined if this new carrier (cv-18) will employ steam or electromagnetic catapults, but it will definitely be a catobar carrier. plan aviators continue to practice catobar take-off and landings at the huangdicun airbase in southern china. chinese naval engineers have had a great deal of success in developing an electromagnetic aircraft launching system (emals) that requires much less energy than the system currently utilized aboard the u.s. navy’s gerald ford class carrier. it remains to be decided if the type 002 will be conventionally powered, or will make use of a nuclear reactor.regardless of the next generation carrier’s specific design specifications and capabilities, powerful surface warfare ships will be required to escort them in a larger aircraft carrier battle group formation. the type 055 ddg will likely serve a similar role as the ticonderoga class cg of the u.s. navy within the carrier strike groups (csg), and will also be utilized as a command ship or heavy aaw and asw platform in plan naval task forces or while supporting amphibious ready groups (arg). the type 055’s significant weapons payload, multifaceted offensive and defensive capabilities, and great range and endurance will aid chinese efforts to protect and expand its maritime territories, protect its shipping lanes, and maintain its naval lines of communication.type 052d ddg continued growtha number of photos that appeared both online and in the print media exhibiting the two newest type 055 ddgs to be launched at the disc shipyard in dalian failed to mention that three brand new type 052d destroyers also appeared in these same images. the type 052d is a powerful guided missile destroyer in its own right, rivaling the u.s. navy arleigh burke class ddg. china launched the first type 052d, the kunming ddg-172 in 2014. there are currently 9 ships of the class in service, 2 undergoing sea trials, and a further two being fitted out. three type 052d ddgs have been commissioned in the first half of this year.although original rumors had hinted at 16 vessels being ordered, some inside sources now claim that the number has been increased significantly. it would seem reasonable that a total of 18 to 26 vessels may end up being built, dependent upon how ambitious the plan aircraft carrier program becomes. ihs janes defense weekly reported on may 2nd of this year that satellite imagery appeared to show a type 052d under construction at the jiangnan changxingdao shipyard in shanghai that had approximately 4 meters (13.1ft) added to its loa. the after flight deck may have been lengthened to accommodate larger helicopters which would aid the vessel in its asw role.it remains to be seen if the above mentioned modification will enter serial production under a different designation, or will prove to be a concept testbed for fielding larger rotary wing assets at sea. it is important to note that china produced six type052c class ddgs from 2004 to 2015, and has produced thirteen of the much improved type 052d class ddgs in just four years, a six fold increase in annual production.more frigates and corvetteswhile smaller warships do not enjoy the limelight of their larger peers, they can teach the observer a great deal about a nation’s maritime defense posture and priorities. while the chinese shipbuilding industry has constructed and launched nineteen type 052 ddgs of both variants, and four type 055 ddgs from 2014 to the present, they have also turned out fourteen type 054a class guided missile frigates (total of 32 of all variants) and a no less than twenty type 056a class corvettes (total of 42 in class of all variants) over the same period of time.the smaller warships traditionally perform a number of different roles in naval warfare. firstly, they serve as coastal patrol craft. they are nimble and fast, heavily armed for their diminutive size, and are outfitted to be flexible enough to perform a multitude of different missions. their small size equates to limited firepower and shorter range, but they are well suited to serve as picket ships and screening forces to task forces fielding larger and more powerful vessels when those fleets are operating within close range of home ports and naval facilities.the type 056a class corvette is ideally suited to patrol china’s coasts, the maritime territories within china’s eez, as well as the island archipelagos of the paracel and spratly islands. they will most likely begin patrol operations from the key island bases at fiery cross reef, subi reef, and mischief reef as the maritime logistics facilities on these islands are improved.the type 054a frigate is a well balance and powerful naval surface combatant for its size, and carries an ample arsenal of anti-aircraft, anti-ship, and anti-submarine weapons. it is an ideal escort vessel with a range of over 8,000 nautical miles. it is a traditional multi-purpose frigate, possessing the inherent ability to attack other surface ships, engage aircraft, and track and destroy submarines. it is this class of warship that the plan first sent to the gulf of aden in 2009 to serve in international anti-piracy duties. eleven type 05a frigates have served on anti-piracy duties in this region since that time.the type 054a class frigate is a flexible, yet powerful surface warfare asset that possesses significant range and the ability to engage in a multitude of operations. it is equipped with an aft hangar and flight deck, and carries either a ka-28 or harbin z-9 helicopter depending on mission requirements. type 054a ffgs will likely be deployed as part of naval flotillas stationed on a rotational basis at the plan naval base in djibouti, and eventually at gwadar, pakistan. they will also be used to police the long maritime supply lines to and from china to strategic waterways near the horn of africa and the straits of hormuz, as well as continuing patrols in the south china and east china seas.new nuclear submarineswithout a doubt one of the segments of chinese defense strategy most shrouded in mystery are the attack submarines and ballistic missile submarines of the plan. they are very rarely a topic of discussion by government officials, either on or off the record. what is known is that the plan has a newer ssn and ssbn in service. china’s submarine technology has run behind that of both the united states and russia for decades, but china has been rapidly closing the gap in recent years. it is no secret that chinese espionage efforts to acquire u.s. submarine warfare technology have been very active, and quite successful over the past decade in particular.the most capable nuclear attack submarine (ssn) in service with the plan is the type 093b. a notable improvement over the type 093, it has the capability to fire submarine launched cruise missiles (slcm) while submerged via a dorsal mounted vls. like its predecessor, the type 093, it retains the ability to fire slcms from its bow torpedo tubes. this is accomplished by using a specifically designed torpedo tube missile canister. it is not known how many type 093b ssns are currently in service, but most analysts, including those at the u.s. office of naval intelligence, put the number at six. of greater interest is the newer ssn that is either currently being fitted out or is undergoing sea trials later this year, the type 095.the type 095 is an ssn, but reportedly has a sizeable vls (12-16 cells) which can fire a multitude of plan missiles including anti-ship cruise missiles (ascm) and land attack cruise missiles (lacm). the u.s. office of naval intelligence has classified the type 095 as a nuclear attack guided missile submarine (ssgn) due to its large missile capacity. the type 095 is thought to utilize pump-jet propulsion, make use of noise reducing technologies, and a hybrid pressure hull design.the type 095 is being constructed at the new bohai shipbuilding heavy industry company (bshic) submarine manufacturing facility located in huludao, in the liaoning province. it is the largest submarine manufacturing facility in the world, with an assembly building measuring some 430,000 square feet (39,948 sq. meters). completed in 2017, the main assembly hall can accommodate four submarines at any given time. the facility is totally enclosed, and operations cannot be viewed from the air or via satellite surveillance. this also allows manufacturing operations to continue year round regardless of weather conditions. the facility will be used to build all type 095 ssn and type 096 ssbn class submarines.the type 094 jin class nuclear ballistic missile submarine has also undergone a noticeable transformation, resulting in what has been renamed the type 094a. improvements to the new variant include a larger vls aft of the conning tower, a more streamlined shape which produces less noise and cavitation while submerged, likely greater speed submerged (less hydrodynamic drag), and a new ballistic missile armament. the type 094a is most likely equipped with the next generation jl-2a submarine launched ballistic missile (slbm). the jl-2a is based on the df-31, and has an estimated maximum range of 11,200 kilometers (6,960 miles). the jl-2a is likely equipped with a multiple independently targetable reentry vehicle (mirv) warhead. the plan likely has between four and six type 094/094a class ssbns in service. these ssbns serve as the third leg of the nuclear deterrent triad that china lacked for so many years, and the 094a offers china a viable second strike capability. the type 096 ssbn currently being designed will offer notable improvements over the 094a ssbn, yet little is known about the project.the sixth and final type 071 lpd?the final type 071 class lpd of the original order of six vessels was launched at the hudong-zhonghua shipyard on january 20th of this year. the fifth vessel was launched just 7 months prior. it remains unknown if the plan will decide to order additional lpds of this class, or will concentrate instead on the larger type 075 lhds currently under construction at the same shipyard which constructed all six type 071 lpds.it is logical to conclude that china may decide to build additional type 071 lpds, but this will depend perhaps on how long it takes to construct, launch and commission the first of the new class of lhds. with six lpds in service, after the final two vessels are finally commissioned, the plan will always have at least two of them ready to deploy as the backbone of a small amphibious ready group (arg). a plan arg would likely consist of at least one type 071 lpd, 2 type 072 lsts and a surface warfare escort of a mix of ddgs and ffgs.these smaller amphibious warfare vessels lack the size and capability of bringing their own aviation strike element with them. the type 071 can accommodate two helicopters on its large aft flight deck, and is equipped to house four helicopters in the adjacent hangar. the type 072 lst can also accommodate one helicopter on its after flight deck. lacking a vstol attack aircraft, the plan will most likely modify the z-10 attack helicopter for naval use, with it serving a similar purpose as the u.s. marine corps ah-1z viper and russian ka-52k naval attack helicopters. china has already conducted take-off and landing tests with z-10s on both the type 071 lpd and 072a lst. the type 075 lhd will undoubtedly have an attack element of at least eight to ten modified z-10s.it is clear that a larger amphibious warfare platform is a requirement for the plan in the immediate future. if the time it took china to design, build, launch and fit-out its first indigenous aircraft carrier is an indicator, we are likely looking at the first type 075 to be launched sometime in 2020. fitting out and sea trails will take an additional two years before the first vessel is commissioned. the lhd is without a doubt the most flexible and capable of all amphibious warfare platforms and the plan will need these vessels to be able to field viable args to respond to challenges within its maritime territories and to project power at greater ranges along the full length and breadth of the maritime silk road.the all important support vesselschina signaled to the world that it fully intended to field aircraft carrier battle groups (cbg) in the near future when it launched the first type 901 fast combat support ship in december of 2015. built by guangzhou shipyard international company ltd. (gsi), the first vessel in this class hulun hu (hull # 965), commissioned in september of 2017 after successful sea trials and unrep trails, bears the distinction of being the only fast combat support ship fielded by a nation other than the united states, which operates the sacramento and supply class vessels. these massive underway replenishment ships are designed to be able to meet the logistics needs of fast moving carrier battle/strike groups.the type 901 is a massive vessel, with a fully loaded displacement of 48,000 tons. it is equipped with five liquid bulk cargo transfer stations, three on the port side and two on the starboard side, and is also equipped for liquid transfers astern. they can refuel an aircraft carrier with fuel oil and aviation fuel to starboard while supplying fuel oil to surface warfare escorts to port. the disclosed cruising speed is in excess of 25 knots, which is likely understated. it is equipped with a large aircraft hangar and flight deck that can accommodate large z-8 heavy transport helicopters which are well suited to aerial replenishment duties. a second type 901 is currently in an advanced state of construction.the plan also operates the type 903 and type 903a class fleet replenishment vessels. the type 903 was greatly improved and took on the designation type 903a with the first two examples commissioned in the summer of 2013. there are six type 903a replenishment ships on active service, and a seventh currently in an advanced state of construction. these vessels have a fully loaded displacement of approximately 24,000 tons and can carry 10,500 tons of bunkers (fuel), 250 tons of potable water, and roughly 700 tons of dry cargo.fleet replenishment vessels are a vital component of a blue water navy. they allow fleet task forces, carrier battle groups and amphibious ready groups to engage in complex missions thousands of miles from home ports and over extended periods of duration. they replenish fuel, food stores, fresh water and munitions to warships while underway, and can provide a rapid logistics solution to both naval and land forces deployed to far flung bases and garrisons. these vessels are indispensable to aircraft carrier battle groups engaged in long deployments.the big picture, plan 2025the rapid pace of warship construction by china is impressive from an engineering and manufacturing standpoint, but of greater interest is in understanding the motivation behind such an ambitious program. why has the chinese leadership decided that the plan must expand and acquire a full spectrum of naval warfare capabilities that it has previously lacked, and in such a short space of time? the answer to this question becomes clear after a short analysis of china’s geopolitical, economic and national security goals in the twenty-first century.in many ways, china is engaged in a concerted effort to redefine the economic realities that have established the way the world exchanges goods and services, and distributes the product of human endeavors globally. the new silk road/maritime silk road project seeks to once again make china the center of the economic world. china is already the largest economy in the world in terms of economic production, and is on pace to usurp the u.s. as the world’s largest economic consumer as well. continued growth and prosperity depend upon cheap and efficient movement of energy resources and raw materials to china, and the cheap and efficient movement of finished goods from china. the overwhelming majority of these influxes and outflows transit the international waterways of the world. continued prosperity and stability depend upon the security of these maritime lanes of trade. in strategic terms, these naval lines of communication must remain open. in times of strife and natural or man-made disaster, china must have the capacity to secure these lines of communication and to keep them open. the great naval strategist rear admiral alfred thayer mahan, writing in 1893, then just a captain, stated this concept very succinctly:“let us start from the fundamental truth, warranted by history, that the control of the seas, and especially along the great lines drawn by national interest or national commerce, is the chief among the merely material elements in the power and prosperity of nations. it is so because the sea is the world’s great medium of circulation. from this necessarily follows the principal that, as subsidiary to such control, it is imperative to take possession, when it can be done righteously, of such maritime positions as contribute to secure command.”although china has been the first and most determined nation to move in this direction, it is not alone. as china moves to build a new logistics system that aims to redirect the movement of information, energy, and economic goods that competes with the current established system dominated by the united states, the united states and its allies are determined to maintain the status quo. some of these allies, such as india, are allies of necessity and are also attempting to maintain their independence. china has accepted the wisdom of long standing naval strategy, and has proven the most decisive in embracing these centuries old concepts.if china does not alter its current building projects by increasing or reducing orders, the plan will still be a highly transformed fighting force by 2025. the year 2025 will prove to be a milestone for the plan for many reasons. by 2025, china will likely be declaring its first type 002 class aircraft carrier operational. the type 002 will be an emals assisted catobar capable carrier that may likely be nuclear powered. at the same time, two other aircraft carriers, although recognized as developmental steps along the way to the type 002, will also be in service. based on the pace of pilot training and the procurement of aircraft over the past decade, the plan will have at least one more regiment of carrier strike aircraft in service, bringing the total to two regiments. china is already seeking to develop and field a carrier borne strike aircraft superior to the j-15, even though many of the j-15’s shortcoming will be rectified by the improved catobar system of the new type 002 carrier.the plan will have 30 type 054a frigates, 18 type 052d and 8 or more type 055 destroyers in service. improvements upon the destroyers will likely occur in the intervening years. a total of 50 type 056 corvettes (28 of the type 056a improved variant) will be policing the coastal waterways of china and its outlying island territories. these modern and capable surface warfare vessels will be supplemented by older vessels that china has been actively modernizing.the plan will be able to transport an enlarged pla marine corps to battle in its first amphibious ready group, albeit with limited capabilities. the first type 075 lhd will be undergoing operational training to test the capabilities of the vessel and familiarize sailors, marines and airmen with amphibious and air assault missions from such a complex and powerful platform. there will be six type 071 lpds in service, as well as 15 type 072a lsts. the majority of an additional 17 type 072 lsts of an earlier, yet sound design will still be in service. the recently expanded plamc, numbering approximately 100,000 men, a five-fold increase from 2017, will finally have the modern amphibious sealift capacity that it currently lacks. plamc marines will serve in duties deployed at sea and stationed at a growing number of chinese sovereign island bases, or abroad at naval bases in foreign countries such as pakistan and djibouti.by 2025, the plan will have a robust naval logistics arm available to support naval operations across the length and breadth of the maritime silk road. two type 901 fast combat supports ships, and 9 type 903a replenishment ships will be available at a minimum. four type 904 general stores issue vessels are currently in service to resupply island garrisons and offshore bases. this number may be increased in the intervening years.of equal interest is the question of just how the u.s. navy will look in 2015. it will still be the largest and most powerful navy in terms of global reach and power projection; however, it is a military branch that seems to be without focus or direction. the plan has increasingly invested in high tech, powerful and flexible conventional warships that are also cost effective when compared to the new designs pursued by the u.s. navy. even the type 002 aircraft carrier is a conservative design, with a limited mission foreseen for it, one which will minimize its weaknesses and make use of its strengths. it is telling that china has built the largest surface warfare ship since the u.s. commissioned the last ticonderoga class cruiser port royal cg-73 in 1994. the u.s. has no plans to replace the 22 ticonderoga class cruisers anytime soon, nor is there a replacement design to consider. the gerald r. ford class cvn-78 has proven to be a costly and disappointing investment so far. it will use the f-35 jsf and f-18 super hornet which lack the range to be a threat to peer adversaries. the zumwalt class ddg is a dead end failure and the troubled lcs program has proven to be less capable than the traditional multi-purpose frigate designs of other major navies.while the u.s. has wasted its great wealth on failed designs, whose sole aim is to earn profits for a defense industry more interested in profit-generating waste than in producing weapons systems that balance capability, efficiency and cost effectiveness, china has done something quite different. china has produced cutting edge warships and aircraft for its navy that are largely improvements upon proven designs and technology. china has made major progress in missile technology, surpassing the u.s. in many respects. it has also reaped rewards from years of investment in research and development of advanced radar and even photon detection technologies. there is no doubt that china has gotten far more return on its investments in terms of its defense industry in comparison to the united states. for the military defense complex that rules the united states the goal is profit, not the defense and security of the nation.from 2001 to the present, the united states military has morphed into a force obsessed with counterinsurgency and occupation, leaving it woefully unprepared for a conventional conflict with peer adversaries, such as russia or china. the u.s. navy has transformed into a global police force meant to be used as a stick to bludgeon any small nation that dares to disobey the diktats of washington. its powerful aircraft carrier strike groups (csg) lack the air wing capable of striking the shores of powerful adversaries, rendering these great symbols of u.s. power impotent against any capable foe in a major conflict. the u.s. navy is powerless to change the strategic situation in the south china sea through military means, as china has already “crossed the rubicon”. imperial hubris, corruption and arrogance have done greater damage to the u.s. military than any foreign adversary has over the past 17 years.the year 2025 will witness a plan in ascent and a u.s. navy in decline. this is not to say that the u.s. navy will not still be the preeminent naval power globally, but it will continue to be mired in a lack of strategic direction, focus and budgetary crisis. the plan will be guided by a clear strategic focus, increasing capabilities, and a robust shipbuilding and weapons acquisition program. there is no doubt that the plan will emerge as the second most powerful navy in the world, and will exert significant influence in both military and geostrategic terms.donate', 'saturday, august 25: crypto markets are showing bullish sign of a persuasive recovery. virtually all of the top

increased from $210 billion to $215 billion within a two-day period, fueled by the short-term surge in the price of tokens.ethereum-based tokens like wanchain, aion, and icon recorded solid gains in the range of 10 to 20 percent against both the us dollar and bitcoin, showing some momentum against major cryptocurrencies.ethereum, ripple, bitcoin cash, and eos, the top five cryptocurrencies in the global market, have struggled to demonstrate a recovery in their volume and price, closing the day with mere 0.3 to 1 percent gains, falling behind bitcoin and the rest of the market.bitcoin dominance still strongin previous reports, ccn noted that the dominance index of btc, which measures the dominance of the cryptocurrency over the global market, is an important metric to measure the short-term growth and momentum of tokens and small market cap cryptocurrencies.in the past seven days, the dominance index of btc has increased from 51 percent to 53.6 percent, despite the recovery in the price of btc.under normal circumstances, tokens tend to demonstrate 10 to 20 percent gains if btc rises by 3 to 5 percent in value, as investors become more confident in investing in high-risk and high-return trades. however, this week, tokens have not been able to record large movements on the upside.bitcoin’s strong dominance over the market suggests that investors are thoroughly convinced that the corrective rally from $6,200 to $6,700 has established a platform for the rest of the market to continue a short-term rally over the upcoming weeks.while many analysts have suggested that the momentum of bitcoin will likely enable the dominant cryptocurrency to surpass the $7,000 mark, it may take bitcoin to break out of the $7,000 resistance level for tokens to see a rapid increase in value in the short-term.throughout the past few months, btchas declined by more than 30 percent, from the $9,000 region to mid-$6,000. tokens have fallen 60 to 70 percent against bitcoin, recording 95 percent losses against the us dollar.over the past 12 hours, 10 percent of bitcoin short contracts on bitfinex, the biggest margin trading platform in the cryptocurrency market, have been closed, suggesting that bears are not confident in betting against the newly found momentum of bitcoin.as such, it is more likely for bitcoin to test the $7,000 mark in the next few days, rather than dropping back to the lower end of the $6,000 region.bear market is not over, but good to accumulateerik voorhees, the ceo of shapeshift, one of the most popular peer-to-peer digital asset exchanges in the market, has said that the bear market is not over for crypto but it is a good time to accumulate given the low price range of most cryptocurrencies.most investors still expect the price of bitcoin to endure one last minor correction before initiating a mid-term rally but the general sentiment around the crypto market remains positive.featured image from shutterstock. charts from tradingview.advertisement', 'this week in the industry, we saw the gears of government and regulation grinding, we check in on some mining news and we take a moment to reflect on the state of the market and industry innovation. here are some of bitcoin magazine’s top bitcoin, blockchain and cryptocurrency news stories for the week.stay on top of the best stories in the bitcoin, blockchain and cryptocurrency industry. subscribe to our newsletter here.the latest in regulationnot a done deal: u.s. sec “will review” most recent etf decisionschina blocks access to over 120 offshore digital currency exchangeswechat shuts down numerous crypto media accountstop crypto exchanges join winklevosses’ self-regulatory organizationthis wednesday, the united states securities and exchange commission released orders on nine bitcoin exchange traded fund (etf) proposals. each of the three orders, like those that preceded them, shot down all of the etfs in question.but these decisions, the sec revealed the next day, are now up for review. this development has offered a glimmer of hope for the industry in its slow-slog toward a bitcoin-backed, exchange-traded product.in the march toward clearer crypto regulation in the states, exchanges have taken the lead in an attempt to quicken the pace. the virtual currency association, a self-regulatory organization spearheaded by the winklevosses and their gemini exchange, added three new members this week. with these latest additions, the vca continues to work toward its goal of “establishing an industry-sponsored, self-regulatory organization (sro) to oversee virtual commodity marketplaces,” in advance of a summit to be held this september.while the u.s. grapples with regulations and oversight for its own virtual currency markets, the chinese government is looking to siphon its citizens’ access to crypto trading venues. chinese officials shuttered access to over 120 offshore exchanges this week, an extreme measure to accompany the comprehensive ban it effected on domestic icos in september 2017.meanwhile in the private sector, wechat is assisting the government with its crackdown. the number one messaging platform in china purged crypto and blockchain media accounts from its services this week, citing the government’s policies toward icos as justification for the bans.news from the bitcoin mining industrysoftbank denies reports of bitmain deal; bitmain still silentmining like a viking: how the fjords of norway offer a greener alternativeall eyes were on bitmain this week, as public and media scrutiny continues to pick apart the details of the chinese mining behemoth’s forthcoming public offering.after reports surfaced last week claiming that japanese telecom company softbank and chinese internet provider tencent had invested in bitmain via a private pre-ipo funding round, a handful of companies came forward this week to deny their involvement.in a feature article, bitcoin magazine’s colin harper took a trip to norway to survey the work of northern bitcoin, a german mining company that has taken advantage of the abundance of renewable energy norway’s fjords produce.situated in lefdal mine, a defunct mine turned data center in måløy, the 3,250 miner strong asic mining farm operates at nearly half the electricity cost of its competitors and with zero co2 emissions. it’s a reminder that, with the right infrastructure and a tinge of creativity, bitcoin mining can be more sustainable than its critics suggest.rehashing old arguments and looking aheadnew research claims satoshi mined far fewer bitcoins than previously thoughtop ed: making friends with time in the cryptocurrency spaceever since bitcoin developer sergio lerner presented compelling evidence on the topic in 2013, the bitcoin community has assumed that satoshi nakamoto mined — and held on to — roughly 1,000,000 bitcoin during the network’s inaugural year. new evidence from bitmex research, on the other hand, suggests that this figure may be in the ballpark of 600,000-700,000 btc.finally, iost ceo jimmy zhong reminds us of the importance of perspective in times of market anemia. these are the times, zhong argues, that real growth can be realized, and that those who focus their efforts on development despite the downturn will be better for it when things start to look up again.“life is a long journey. we often say that choice is more important than effort. we also need to understand that desire and choices only pull through with persistence. i hope we can have faith in our common choice, the future of technology, the power of market cycles; remain unwavering in the face of swaying market sentiment; make independent and clear-headed judgments; and, together, build something people truly want,” zhong writes.', 'according to research from prominent cryptocurrency trader jacob canfield, who plotted out his findings against a btc price chart on the popular charting site tradingview, cnbc’s tweets can be used as a contrarian bitcoin price indicator with as much as 95% accuracy.cnbc: a contrarian indicator with 95% accuracycanfield claims that almost “every single bullish tweet” has been at or near the top of nearly every btc rally in 2018. meanwhile, each bearish tweet has represented a reversal of a previous downtrend.in the last week alone, candield says, cnbc has made three bearish tweets, potentially indicating that bitcoin has reached a bottom.canfield, who operates a daily crypto trading signal site, says that cnbc themselves have reached out to the trader to potentially be a guest on one of their shows.cnbc has been long been seen as a contrarian indicator after famously reporting on how to buy ripple after the cryptocurrency reached an all-time high of $3, only to then report on how to sell the #3 cryptocurrency by market cap after a massive sell off to below $1 had occurred, at the time signaling the then-bottom for xrp.considering the accuracy of canfield’s research and the consistency at which cnbc seems to make contrarian calls, let’s hope that cnbc decides that bitcoin is a bust in their upcoming documentary, which could signal the final rally that ends the 2018 bear market.bitcoin: boom or bust?as bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency by market cap and the cryptocurrency that started it all, reaches a pivotal moment in its existence, major american media brand cnbc will air a special 60-minute documentary this coming monday night, august 27.on monday, august 27, at 6pm et, cnbc will air a new documentary focused on bitcoin. the documentary, entitled “bitcoin: boom or bust” and hosted by cnbc fast money host melissa lee, will be a deep dive into the original peer-to-peer electronic cash created by the mysterious satoshi nakamoto.according to a press release, the documentary will explore the “good, bad, and the ugly” sides of bitcoin. topics include crypto evangelists, how bitcoin is used by escorts in the sex trade industry, billionaire venture capitalists, crypto revolution anarchists, and much more.“this original documentary employs pop culture, captivating imagery and a hip-hop score (a staple in crypto-culture) as it follows a wide range of fascinating characters, each with their own passionate argument either for or against bitcoin.”cnbc plans to show both sides of the “coin,” including commentary from bears and bulls alike. this includes what cnbc calls a “riveting and colorful interview” with the wolf of wall street, jordan belfort, who compares bitcoin to the scams he ran during his con man days, as well as a “chilling tour” through the dark web to let viewers see the often unseen criminal underworld associated with cryptocurrency.', 'published on aug 24,

good sign. btc is up 2.7% on the day to trade at just over $6,700. on the week it has made just 3.4% however and needs to pass $7k for any real momentum to gather. ethereum has stalled once again and has not really moved over the past few days getting stuck at just below $280 on the day.altcoins are largely in the green according to coinmarketcap, however gains are marginal once again today. in

cryptocurrency-related “bold and vicious fraud,” bloomberg reported august 24.earlier this year, patrick mcdonnell, cryptocurrency promoter and operator of cabbagetech corp., was charged with “fraud and misappropriation in connection with purchases and trading of bitcoin (btc) and litecoin (ltc).” mcdonnell subsequently argued that the cftc did not have the authority to regulate his commercial operations; however, new york district judge jack b. weinstein rejected his claim.in july, weinstein reportedly held a nonjury trial where he claimed that mcdonnell ran a “boiler room,” deceptively luring investors in different states and counties using “trickery, false statements and misappropriation of funds,” bloomberg notes. weinstein delivered a judgement that mcdonnell must pay $290,429 in restitution and $871,287 in penalties.according to bloomberg, cabbagetech was not represented by a lawyer, as mcdonnell claimed he could not afford to pay for counsel. mcdonnell also stopped appearing in court during the trial.mcdonnell was also involved in a different lawsuit by the cftc against his another company, coin drop markets. the cftc claimed in the the lawsuit that customers who paid mcdonnell and coin drop for crypto trading advice did not receive the advice they paid for, and that mcdonnell shut down coin drop’s website and failed to respond to customers. the lawsuit also notes that coin drop was not registered with the cftc.last month, speaking from capitol hill, congressman bill huizenga argued that congress should empower financial regulators such as the u.s. securities and exchange commission (sec) and the cftc to regulate the cryptocurrency market in compliance with the same rules governing other currencies and stocks.in may, the cftc chairman chris giancarlo said he doesn’t see comprehensive crypto legislation coming from the federal level in the near future, pointing out that the statutes by which the cftc is operating were written in 1935. he added that embracing a modern innovation like bitcoin within terms invented decades ago will take time.', 'advertisementthe sec has disapproved 10 bitcoin exchange-traded funds (etfs) in the past month but analysts believe bakkt can assist the launch of the first bitcoin etf.bakkt’s efforts in finding trusted price formationlast month, the sec officially rejected the winklevoss bitcoin etf filed with the bats bzx exchange with a 92-paged document which explicitly stated that the commission was not satisfied with the dependence of the value of the etf on public cryptocurrency exchanges.specifically, the sec said that strictly regulated exchanges like gemini operating in the us market with a proper license are still not resistant to manipulation, and hence, there exists risk involved in basing the base value of a bitcoin etf on the price listed on exchanges.“in section iii.b, the commission addresses bzx’s assertion that bitcoin and bitcoin markets, including the gemini exchange, are uniquely resistant to manipulation and finds that the record before the commission does not support such a conclusion,” the sec said.but, the sec further emphasized that the disapproval of the winklevoss bitcoin etf does not signify the commission’s stance on cryptocurrency or blockchain but simply the lack of a trusted price formation that may leave the etf and the global bitcoin market open to price manipulation.the sec added:“although the commission is disapproving this proposed rule change, the commission emphasizes that its disapproval does not rest on an evaluation of whether bitcoin, or blockchain technology more generally, has utility or value as an innovation or an investment.”conclusively, the denial of the winklevoss etf mainly pertained to its reliance on gemini to establish the value of btc, which the sec did not approve of.bakkt already solved 2 issues laid out by secrecently, bakkt, a new company designed to bring digital assets to the mainstream created by microsoft, starbucks, and new york stock exchange (nyse), stated that it is working on building a consistent regulatory construct; transparent, efficient price discovery; and an institutional quality pre- and post-trade infrastructure.more importantly, bakkt, which is targeting to serve institutional investors in the us market, said that its exchange will not allow btc to be traded on margin or leverage, which is the primary reason why the nine etfs from proshares and direxion were rejected this week.[editor’s note: the sec has since said that the commission will review those rulings, which had been made by agency employees.]“a critical element to price discovery is physical delivery. specifically, with our solution, the buying and selling of bitcoin is fully collateralized or pre-funded. as such, our new daily bitcoin contract will not be traded on margin, use leverage, or serve to create a paper claim on a real asset,” the bakkt team said.in the past month, the sec laid out the following to issues as the main problems of the 10 etfs that were rejected:lack of trusted price formationreliance on futures markets and derivativesthe bakkt exchange satisfies both requirements from the sec and if bakkt continues to establish its focus on finding a trusted price formation, it is possible that it could impact the approval of the first bitcoin

seem like an unlikely source: cobra, the pseudonymous co-owner of bitcointalk and bitcoin.org.earlier this year, cobra — originally a critic of bitcoin cash — came out in support of bch, though he continues to also support btc while taking some controversial positions such as arguing for a change to the network’s proof-of-work (pow) consensus algorithm.now, he’s launching what he calls a “safe and reliable” full node bitcoin cash implementation in an attempt to prevent a civil war between bch development teams bitcoin abc and nchain from causing a network split that permanently damages the cryptocurrency’s reputation.dubbed “cobra client,” the software adopts neither canonical transaction ordering nor any of opcode activations proposed by bitcoin abc and nchain, which cobra argues do not have enough consensus support to justify immediate activation.what it does include, however, is replay protection, ensuring that users who run this instance of the bch software will not be at risk of replay attacks — which occur when an attacker broadcasts the same transaction on multiple blockchain forks — if the network splits into two or more chains following the scheduled network hard fork in november, which increasingly seems like an inevitability.according to cobra, such a blockchain split would be a “disaster” for bitcoin cash and even a temporary fork would “cause lasting damage.”he wrote:“such a consensus failure will be a disaster for all investors and users of bitcoin cash, but it is almost impossible to avoid at this point as all the developers and miners involved refuse to back down. such a scenario will wipe out huge amounts of value from bitcoin cash, lead to total ridicule of the currency, and widespread loss of trust and faith. such reputation damage is simply not worth it, all just so some developers and miners can avoid having their egos bruised around some mostly unimportant and non-urgent changes. even a temporary fork will cause lasting damage.”cobra claims that, prior to announcing his client, he worked behind-the-scenes to secure support from a broad coalition of bch stakeholders. this group, he says, includes at least a quarter of the bitcoin cash hashrate (nchain’s proposal also has explicit support from about one-fourth of the hashrate), as well as “a number of major businesses” including one “major cryptocurrency exchange” who has agreed to list the cobra fork’s coins under the “bch” ticker symbol. however, he has not yet disclosed the identities of these supporters, nor have they come forward.this isn’t the first attempt to broker a compromise ahead of the fork. bitcoin unlimited, whose software client is used by approximately one-third of bch node operators, has said that it will make all of the changes proposed by abc and nchain available in its software and has encouraged users to switch to bu to signal their support for a compromise that will afford miners more control over which individual upgrades activate on the network.featured image from shutterstockadvertisement', 'once again, bitcoin finds itself precariously perched on the bottom of its macro trading range (tr). after a strong round of selling over the course of two weeks plunged the price back to the $6,000s, bitcoin began consolidating for several weeks at the bottom of the tr:figure 1: btc-usd, 1-day candles, macro tras shown in the figure above, the market has interacted several times at the current price range and it has been a source of three major bullish rallies. currently, there is a lot of bearish pressure trying to submerge the price but very little price movement. if we take a look at the open long and open short positions on bitfinex, we actually see a record-setting short count for the year as shorts outnumber the longs by almost 30%:figure 2: btc-usd, 1-day candles, longs vs. shortsso far, this is the highest the short count has been since bitcoin topped late last year. also, one thing to note is not only how high the short count is, but how high it is compared to the open long positions.in situations like this, where the shorts far outnumber the longs, the perfect scenario for what’s known as a “short squeeze” is created. if the shorts continue to stack within a given price range, as we are seeing now, then there is a high possibility for a cascade of short liquidations/short covering to take place.basically, what happens is this: as shorts begin to liquidate, they are forced to buy back their position and propel the price higher. this movement, in turn, begins to liquidate the other positions with stops set just above them which then cascade the liquidations (and the price) higher and higher.if we look at the bollinger bands (bbands) on the daily candles, we can see the price is consolidating very tightly as the bbands have begun to “squeeze” around the price action thus indicating price consolidation.figure 3: btc-usd, 1-day candles, bollinger band consolidationtypically, when bbands squeeze, this is a forecast for increased volatility. and, because these are daily candles, it is likely that the next move will be a macro move in either direction.it’s impossible to know with certainty which way the price will move, but given the number of shorts that keep opening — and the relatively low amount of price movement — the stage is set for a pretty sizeable move upward.there’s no concrete rule that says “high short count always yields a short squeeze,” but the foundation is definitely laid for one. the last time we had shorts anywhere this level, the price jumped 20% in one day. the short count back then was just under 38k bitcoins. the short count right now is 38.6k bitcoins.summary:bitcoin is, once again, testing the support of the macro tr.as shorts begin to rise, the price is seeing very little reaction. as a result of the high short count over a relatively narrow price range, there is a possibility of a sizeable short squeeze.to further support just how narrow this price range has been and just how tightly wound the market is right now, the daily bbands show a strong squeeze on a macro level that will likely yield a strong move in either direction.trading and investing in digital assets like bitcoin and ether is highly speculative and comes with many risks. this analysis is for informational purposes and should not be considered

their money back, or at least some of it, anyway.according to a notice dated aug. 23 and attributed to mt. gox trustee nobuaki kobayashi, the company has opened an online claim filing system so that creditors can begin registering claims on the funds that they lost when the exchange, once the dominant bitcoin trading platform, became insolvent in 2014. creditors can also fill out claim forms offline and submit them through the mail.as ccn reported, mt. gox went bankrupt after losing an estimated 850,000 btc — most to hackers, but some to embezzlement — although former ceo mark karpeles later found about 200,000 btc. the theft long remained the largest cryptocurrency exchange hack in history, and though it has since been surpassed by the coincheck hack in jan. 2018, it remains the most significant theft in terms of its impact on the industry as a whole.had the exchange remained in bankruptcy, creditors would have been compensated in cash at a rate far below bitcoin’s current market price. meanwhile, karpeles — who has been charged in japan for embezzling funds from the exchange and spent nearly a year in prison while awaiting trial — would have likely received the excess funds accrued from the sale of the company’s remaining cryptocurrency assets, a payout that would have been worth hundreds of millions of dollars.however, a japanese court ruled in june that mt. gox could exit bankruptcy and commence civil rehabilitation proceedings. moving the company into civil rehabilitation does not guarantee that creditors will be refunded in cryptocurrencies rather than cash, but the structure of this type of civil proceeding is much more flexible, which leaves the door open to a direct bitcoin distribution, depending on what stipulations appear in the court-approved rehabilitation plan.according to the mtgox cold wallet monitor, the company’s estate is holding 137,891 btc, worth more than $910 million at the time of writing, as well as an equivalent amount of bitcoin cash, worth $73 million.importantly, all creditors must submit claims on their assets, including those who previously submitted claims as part of the company’s bankruptcy proceedings. the deadline for filing is oct. 22. the trustee will then submit a list of approved and rejected claims to the court by jan. 24, 2019.featured image from shutterstockadvertisement', 'staff at the sec on wednesday rejected applications for new funds from three companies. photo: iolinternational - the us securities and exchange commission said on thursday it will review a decision by its staff to block nine bitcoin-based exchange-traded funds from coming to market.staff at the sec on wednesday rejected applications for new funds from three companies, suggesting they were not yet convinced that the products would not be subject to fraud or manipulation.but the sec’s four commissioners will review those decisions, according to letters the sec posted on its website.sec staff have delegated authority to make a decision on such applications, meaning the commissioners and the sec chairman have the power to review the decision if they desire.the commissioners had previously voted 3-1 to reject another bitcoin etf application, with republican commissioner hester peirce dissenting on the basis she felt doing so stifled innovation.the virtual currency can be used to move money around the world quickly and with relative anonymity, without the need for a central authority, such as a bank or government. a fund holding the currency could attract more investors and push its price higher.bitcoin btc=btsp was trading up nearly 2 percent at $6,480 on the luxembourg-based bitstamp exchange on thursday after the sec posted the letters.- reuters', 'nanog mailing list archivesby date

'economist and new york university professor nouriel roubini is perhaps best known for calling the 2008 financial crisis in a series of articles and presentations starting in 2006. however, roubini is no one trick pony – his research on emerging markets makes him an expert on speculative bubbles of all sorts.it’s no surprise, therefore, that he’s now sticking pins in the entire cryptocurrency/blockchain bubble of bubbles.at last week’s blockshow conference in las vegas, roubini did not mince his words. “there has been a total collapse this year in the cryptocurrency game,” he told an audience largely skeptical of his point of view. “it’s a crypto apocalypse.”deflating bitcoin and all other cryptos as wellnouriel wasted no time poking holes in every bitcoin sacred cow. for example, the claim that bitcoin can serve as money. “bitcoin is not money. to be money it would need to be a unit of account, means of payment, and a stable source of value and purchasing power,” nouriel explained. “bitcoin is none of these. other cryptos are worse.”he contrasted bitcoin and other blockchain-based payment technologies with modern payment systems like paypal , square , and alipay in china. “today’s digital systems are used by millions of people per day, and have nothing to do with blockchain,” he said.bitcoin’s second sacred cow to fall to roubini’s withering arguments: decentralization. “decentralization is a total myth,” roubini explained, as crypto miners (transaction processors), exchanges, developers, and wealth are all in fact centralized.while in theory, anybody can be a crypto miner, successful mining requires immense investment that leads to pooling of mining resources. as a result, “the top five mining pools control 70% of all mining,” roubini pointed out – mostly in places like russia, china, belarus, and other places where organized crime syndicates dominate the crypto world.centralization of wealthcrypto aficionados tout its ability to distribute wealth beyond financial insiders to anyone with a smartphone. the reality, however, is quite different. not only is 99% of crypto trading taking place on a small number of centralized exchanges, but the people with the wealth from such trading are few in number as well.to illustrate the extent that crypto centralizes wealth, roubini referred to the gini coefficient, an economic term that expresses distribution of wealth across a population from 0% (everybody equally wealthy) to 100% (one person has all the wealth.)the gini coefficient for europe, for example, is about 50%. north korea stands at 86%. and bitcoin? how about 88%. “bitcoin wealth is more concentrated than north korean wealth,” roubini pointed out.taking the wind out of tokensas i concluded in my last article, much of the activity around blockchain is nothing more than pathetic sleight-of-hand games with worthless tokens.i’m sure roubini would agree. “a world with thousands of tokens makes zero economic sense,” he said. “tokens are only good for gouging consumers.”if tokens don’t make sense, then it would follow that initial coin offerings (icos) wouldn’t make much sense either. “icos are effectively non-compliant securities,” he said, pointing out that while many ico fans position their ‘coins’ as utility tokens rather than security tokens to avoid securities laws, the reality is that they are in fact securities – and in the us at least, illegal ones.what about smart contracts?ethereum is the second most popular crypto behind bitcoin, likely because it’s possible to run ‘smart contracts’ on the ethereum blockchain. what does roubini think of smart contracts? “they’re neither smart nor contracts,” he said.they are too plagued with hard-to-fix bugs to be smart, and until the lawyers give the thumbs up, the word ‘contract’ is overly optimistic as well.furthermore, even though ethereum has become established in crypto circles, smart contracts – and the distributed apps or ‘dapps’ that leverage them – haven’t amounted to much. “75% of dapps are crypto kitties, ponzi schemes, and casino games,” roubini pointed out.where does that leave blockchain? “a peer-to-peer distributed public ledger is total nonsense,” roubini added – leaving only private, permissioned blockchain solutions with trusted individuals or organizations processing the transactions.when the scammers have milked the crypto insanity for all its worth and they and their marks have all gone home, permissioned blockchain solutions – what i refer to as ‘enterprise blockchain’ – will be all that remains.intellyx publishes the agile digital transformation roadmap poster, advises companies on their digital transformation initiatives, and helps vendors communicate their agility stories. as

coins on coinmarketcap, iota (miota), vechain (vet), and zcash (zec) are seeing the strongest upswing on the day, up around 6.6, 8.7 and 4.9 percent respectively.total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies is at around $217 billion at press time, vying to reclaim its mid-week high of $221.7 billion, and up almost $13 billion from its plummet to $204.3 billion august 23.7-day chart of the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies from coinmarketcapmid-week, the markets saw a similar tumble to the one that came in response to july’s news that the winklevoss twins’ high-profile btc etf proposal had also been rejected by the sec, which then saw a comparable $12 billion wiped from total market capitalization.the tumble has nonetheless proved to temporary in the immediate-short term. as crypto analyst brian kelly argued on cnbc this week, the fact that the “market didn’t sell off” on news of the most recent etf denials is a bullish sign of “sentiment change” that suggests many nonetheless expect we are coming “incrementally closer” to eventual etf approval.this has been reinforced by news that the sec plans to review its fresh spate of etf rejections, as well as voices within the agency — notably sec commissioner hester m. peirce — who have officially dissented from the regulator’s prior btc-related etf rejections.', 'advertisementin the past 24 hours, the bitcoin price has increased from $6,400 to $6,700, recording a decent increase in its daily volume.the valuation of the crypto market has increased from $210 billion to $215 billion within a two-day period, fueled by the short-term surge in the price of tokens.ethereum-based tokens like wanchain, aion, and icon recorded solid gains in the range of 10 to 20 percent against both the us dollar and bitcoin, showing some momentum against major cryptocurrencies.ethereum, ripple, bitcoin cash, and eos, the top five cryptocurrencies in the global market, have struggled to demonstrate a recovery in their volume and price, closing the day with mere 0.3 to 1 percent gains, falling behind bitcoin and the rest of the market.bitcoin dominance still strongin previous reports, ccn noted that the dominance index of btc, which measures the dominance of the cryptocurrency over the global market, is an important metric to measure the short-term growth and momentum of tokens and small market cap cryptocurrencies.in the past seven days, the dominance index of btc has increased from 51 percent to 53.6 percent, despite the recovery in the price of btc.under normal circumstances, tokens tend to demonstrate 10 to 20 percent gains if btc rises by 3 to 5 percent in value, as investors become more confident in investing in high-risk and high-return trades. however, this week, tokens have not been able to record large movements on the upside.bitcoin’s strong dominance over the market suggests that investors are thoroughly convinced that the corrective rally from $6,200 to $6,700 has established a platform for the rest of the market to continue a short-term rally over the upcoming weeks.while many analysts have suggested that the momentum of bitcoin will likely enable the dominant cryptocurrency to surpass the $7,000 mark, it may take bitcoin to break out of the $7,000 resistance level for tokens to see a rapid increase in value in the short-term.throughout the past few months, btchas declined by more than 30 percent, from the $9,000 region to mid-$6,000. tokens have fallen 60 to 70 percent against bitcoin, recording 95 percent losses against the us dollar.over the past 12 hours, 10 percent of bitcoin short contracts on bitfinex, the biggest margin trading platform in the cryptocurrency market, have been closed, suggesting that bears are not confident in betting against the newly found momentum of bitcoin.as such, it is more likely for bitcoin to test the $7,000 mark in the next few days, rather than dropping back to the lower end of the $6,000 region.bear market is not over, but good to accumulateerik voorhees, the ceo of shapeshift, one of the most popular peer-to-peer digital asset exchanges in the market, has said that the bear market is not over for crypto but it is a good time to accumulate given the low price range of most cryptocurrencies.most investors still expect the price of bitcoin to endure one last minor correction before initiating a mid-term rally but the general sentiment around the crypto market remains positive.featured image from shutterstock. charts from tradingview.advertisement', 'advertisementa business magnate’s twitter account got hacked and started promising free bitcoin and ethereum to its 22.5 million followers.elon musk, ceo & co-founder of tesla, became the victim of growing hacking incidents on twitter – for the second time. as the tycoon got busy posting philosophical tweets, his impersonator with a verified twitter account joined the thread line and started offering cryptocurrency tips. the fake musk built on real musk’s promise to “take [tesla], private,” stating that the planned reorganization will see the addition of bitcoin and ethereum payment methods as “one of the steps in moving forward.”the extent to which the fake news spread could not be verified. however, some users did fell for it, with one of them accusing musk of stealing from people. while others also questioned how a fake musk was able to obtain a twitter-verified status.twitter recently had emerged as a hotbed for fraudulent account practices. the accounts of many high profile cryptocurrency celebrities, including ethereum co-founder, vitalik buterin, and cybersecurity expert john mcafee, have been impersonated by hackers – with a twitter-verified status.musk himself has been a victim of identity hack already. in february, a fake elon musk profile on twitter had announced that it was giving out 400 eth to fans.twitter later assured its users with better defense frameworks to safeguard profiles. excerpt from its statement on the verge:“we’re aware of this form of manipulation and are proactively implementing a number of signals to prevent these types of accounts from engaging with others in a deceptive manner.”and yet, many fake profiles remain, proving it an arduous task to govern.the anatomy of “free cryptocurrency” scamas of now, there are hundreds of fake accounts on twitter that promise to send free cryptocurrencies to victims. sky news in february reported that a twitter-based scam has siphoned off as much as £50,000 in a day. and such cases are on the rise.the trick to lure victims is stupidly simple. the hackers impersonate high profile accounts and urge victims to send a few quantities of cryptocurrencies units to their wallet address. in return, these hackers promise high yields at a later date. these tricks have worked so well in the past that it has moved legitimate personalities to issue a clarification to their followers. vitalik buterin even changed his twitter profile’s name, stating that he does not give free ether.the only defense a twitter user can apply to safeguard himself is to stay doubtful of profiles promising free cryptocurrencies – even if they are verified.featured image from flickr/ted conference.advertisement', 'ripple: it’s one of the hottest companies in silicon valley, flush with vc cash. dozens of global brand names have announced pilot programs with its technology. one of its products, recently featured on ellen, is the third largest cryptocurrency in the world.yet if you ask the right questions, ripple will all but deny any connection to that famous asset, xrp.the company and its defenders have made “xrp is not ripple” a continuous mantra over the past few months, changed the digital token’s logo, and even amended testimony to the u.k. parliament in a transparent attempt to fend off regulatory scrutiny.and, in a blog post published wednesday, ripple claims that xrp “is in many ways a more transactional, functional and decentralized ledger than either bitcoin or ethereum.” a statement from ripple to breitbart news strips away any caveats: “xrp is even more decentralized than bitcoin and ether.”what is xrp?xrp is a digital “altcoin” that first entered public markets in 2013, though many market analysts call it “ripple” for its close association to the company. it saw a meteoric rise in price over 2017, going from six tenths of a penny in january to an all-time high of $3.79 one year later. at the time of this writing, it has an estimated market capitalization of $13 billion.all digital monies, starting with bitcoin, are simply ledgers — records of credits and debits from a total balance set by their coders — but they are “distributed ledgers,” meaning hundreds or thousands of people all keep a copy of the ledger to compare the integrity of the data. to ensure that no one double spends their personal balance, a network of “nodes” or “validators” stay online 24/7 to check all incoming transactions against the full history of the ledger.why wouldn’t ripple want to claim xrp?as regulators examine the world of digital money — bitcoin and its hundreds of imitators, competitors, and scams — billions of dollars are at stake. none of the major exchanges are yet legally authorized to trade securities, so if the sec declares certain assets to be unregistered securities, they will be universally de-listed and likely see their value drop near zero. and, on top of that calamity, then the coins’ creators may face legal and financial penalties.kyle samani, managing partner at the crypto hedge fund multicoin capital, told fortune in june: “it’s quite clear to us that ripple is a security… if [the sec labels it as such], liquidity is going to dry up on xrp and the price will plummet.”the two biggest, most vulnerable targets for regulators are xrp and the ethereum foundation’s ether, according to former cftc chairman gary gensler. bill hinman, director of the sec’s corporation finance division, has since said that ether in its current state is sufficiently “decentralized” and not considered a security — though that does not automatically mean that the “initial coin offering” for ether was not a securities sale.one big uncertainty hanging over the crypto markets has been whether the 2nd and 3rd largest coins — ether and xrp — should be categorized as securities. a top sec official just said they dont think ether should be, but didnt mention xrp. — nathaniel popper (@nathanielpopper) june 14, 2018but hinman, the sec official, said that if a token is guided by a third party that holds lots of token, and takes actions to increase the value of that token, it is probably a security. that sounds a lot like a description of ripple and xrp. — nathaniel popper (@nathanielpopper) june 14, 2018for ripple, however, the sec — and a growing pile of civil lawsuits alleging that xrp is an unregistered security — remain looming threats. message discipline is a must, and the company has gone into overdrive trying to prove xrp is as “decentralized” as the cryptocurrencies already given a green light by the sec, particularly bitcoin.before we proceed, consider my biases. i own bitcoin, and if its value rises, i stand to gain financially.‘decentralized’david schwartz, the cto of ripple inc., writes on the company’s website that the setup of xrp’s “validators,” which do not utilize “mining,” make the ledger more resistant to bad actors than bitcoin’s.as of today, four mining groups currently control 58 percent of the bitcoin network and three miners account for 57 percent of ethereum’s daily capacity. further, 80 percent of the mining on the bitcoin blockchain is centralized in china, despite the country’s ban on digital assets. this puts it at greater risk of being manipulated by a single, sovereign government. some experts even suggest that in a worst case scenario, miners of bitcoin and ethereum blockchains could use this to their advantage — conspiring to rewrite history on the blockchain through a 51 percent attack that results in verified transactions being unvalidated and allows for fraud to occur. … unlike bitcoin and ethereum — where one miner could have 51 percent of the hashing power — each ripple validator only has one vote in support of an exchange or ordering a transaction.this narrative appears to be a delayed response to a widely-read research article from bitmex, a popular cryptocurrency exchange, which concluded: “the ripple system appears for all practical purposes to be centralised and is therefore perhaps devoid of any interesting technical characteristics, such as censorship resistance.”schwartz addresses this complaint, saying that users can configure their nodes to “users on the xrp ledger select a unique node list (unl), a list of validators trusted by that user… the network has a number of recommended unls, including one list ripple recommends, and users can choose whichever one they prefer or create their own.”bitmex appears to have pre-empted that argument, saying that despite the option of non-ripple unl lists, “there is no evidence that many users of ripple manually change this configuration.”ripple, then, has worked through the year to make its recommendations less reliant on the company’s own servers: “to increase the resiliency and diversity of the network, more than half of the validators on ripple’s recommended unl are operated by people or groups external to the company,” schwartz writes, “and ripple continues to add even more independent validators to the list. this further demonstrates that ripple’s validators do not wield meaningful power over the xrp ledger.”the real issuedid that technical discussion make your eyes glaze over? it’s probably by design. the question of xrp’s technological decentralization, which ripple can take steps to increase, distracts from the token’s economic centralization, which ripple cannot easily wave away.in short, the issue that ripple faces is:1.) when the ledger first launched, the company and its founders owned all xrp.2.) the company has slow-walked the distribution of its xrp reserves. nearly six years later, less than half of the total supply is publicly traded.3.) all xrp enters the market through the company. the company has set a de facto monetary policy for this “inflation” rate.4.) ripple sells its reserves of xrp to exchanges and institutional investors or gives them away for charity and positive press.to understand the extraordinary nature of this approach, we need to understand how it differs from bitcoin’s.the mining competitionbitcoin employs a system called “proof of work” where, approximately every ten minutes, the software saves the most recent state of the ledger in a “block” of transaction information. people running the bitcoin software use their computers to encrypt the newest valid block in a process called “hashing” or, more commonly, “mining.”for the time being, bitcoin does have a programmed inflation rate, or what is called a “block reward.” any time a new block is confirmed, the software gives out a number of new bitcoins to the miner that found it, increasing the ledger’s total balance. when the program first began in 2009, the ledger started with 50 bitcoins, adding 50 more to the balance with each new block. that reward decreases by 50% periodically until it becomes so small (circa 2140) that no new bitcoins will be added to the ledger, capping the total balance at 21 million.people who contribute more hashes have a greater chance of finding a block first and thus getting the block reward, which has led to a profitable market for specialized computer hardware that just spits out hashes as fast as possible. in addition, people will pool their work so that they find blocks more regularly, then split the reward among all the miners according to how much they contributed to the process.the point is, with bitcoin, issuance of new “coins”/credits is a competition that is open to anyone. before any trading or speculation, the software has impartially rewarded new bitcoins to tens of thousands of different people without regard for any aspect of their identities — and despite the emergence of large mining pools, dumb luck still sometimes trumps their overwhelming power. with each block, the mining reward is not pledged to anyone; nothing is guaranteed until a competitor emerges victorious.and the other important facet of this process is that the bitcoin block reward does not enrich any other party besides the miner. the software only receives cryptographic hashes that validate transactions and increase the network’s security in return. no company gets compensated for the issuance of new bitcoins unless they find a block and receive bitcoins.xrp’s central bankby contrast, xrp does not utilize proof of work. its total balance of 100 billion credits was immediately available at the ledger’s genesis. at the time of their creation, there was no competition for those digital credits. all of the xrp made available to the public has been issued through the company and its founders. in the crypto world’s parlance, this is called a “premine.”and since ripple is the issuer of xrp, it was able to unilaterally set an inflation rate for the token. currently, the circulating supply is less than 40 billion xrp, according to coinmarketcap. in december 2017 — shortly before its incredible bull run — the company locked up 55 billion xrp in escrow, to be released at a rate of one billion per month, then re-locking whatever was not sold at the end of each month. ceo brad garlinghouse wrote on the company’s blog, “this lockup eliminates any concern that ripple could flood the market, which we’ve pointed out before is a scenario that would be bad for ripple!”but why would an immediate doubling of xrp liquidity be “bad for ripple”?ripple sells xrp for pure profit; an agreement between the company’s founders explicitly states that the xrp credits (20 billion for themselves, 80 billion for the company) had no value at the time of the company’s incorporation. whether through strategic partners, programmatic sales, or through its licensed money business subsidiary, ripple gets cash for xrp. the company has every incentive to push the token’s price as high as possible. selling, per their figures, an average of 300 million a month above 15 cents for 4+ years will net them billions of dollars — much more than selling 55 billion xrp for the likely sub-penny price that an immediate dump would cause.when ripple distributes xrp for free, it is typically to the company’s benefit — whether by raising awareness of their product early on with a giveaway or by announcing classroom supply donations to the press. an april report by bloomberg alleged that ripple offered to loan $100 million of xrp to coinbase, the largest u.s. exchange between bitcoin and fiat/bank currencies (coinbase listings typically lead to massive price surges).izabella kaminska of the financial times compares ripple’s issuance of xrp to an exchange-traded fund: “it is entirely centrally controlled, operating more like an etf unit than anything else since the issuer has the capacity to release or absorb (pre-mined) tokens in accordance with their valuation agenda.”in contrast, a statement from the company says that the escrow plan contributes to the decentralization of xrp: “ripple has escrowed its xrp such that it only has actual access and control of 13% of the actively traded xrp. the terms of the escrow are such that ripple will likely never have outsized control of the outstanding xrp [emphasis added].” note the necessary caveats — and the failure to address ripple’s central issuance.ripple representatives often say, “if ripple the company shut down tomorrow, xrp will continue to exist.” and while this is technically true of the network/ledger, we don’t know what would happen to ripple’s escrowed xrp — at least half of the supply. the company’s press contact did not respond to questions on that subject.a simplified graphic illustrates the difference between these two digital assets’ issuance models.note that there is no interaction between bitcoin’s software and markets — because distribution is handled in the code. since xrp’s code does not address distribution, aside from a single genesis account that holds all xrp, that process is centrally controlled by the company.this claim to “decentralization” is one of several ways ripple is trying to fight off regulators by obfuscating on its relationship to xrp. stay tuned as we explore these other defenses in the coming days.', 'do you believe in god? would you put your cryptocurrency holdings on it?augur, an ethereum-based platform for betting on the outcome of real-world events, aims to be a repository of crowd-sourced knowledge for journalists, investors and policymakers, as well as an effective tool for hedging against adverse outcomes.but its also become one other thing: a hilarious place to troll.forums for questioning a higher power are just one of many markets that currently exist on the decentralized prediction market, developed by the non-profit forecast foundation and funded with one of the worlds first token sales in 2015.that token sale took place before people were even using the word initial coin offering, or ico, to refer to these types of crypto fundraising schemes, and the project went through the ico boom in beta – with the developers testing and vetting one of the most hotly-anticipated launches in crypto history.as such, when it launched on ethereums live blockchain last month, it briefly surpassed the most famous decentralized application, cryptokitties, in terms of the number of users. although enthusiasm has since dipped markedly.so far, most of augurs markets – and the vast majority of the trades on the platform – deal with relatively vanilla topics like the outcomes of sporting events or the prices of crypto assets. but a few take a truly dark turn, gauging the likelihood that prominent figures will be assassinated or that terrorist attacks and mass shootings will occur.others, though, are just goofy, evoking the cryptocurrency communitys peculiar obsessions, wild rumors and the sorts of riddles a bridge troll might ask before letting you pass.so heres to the augur users who have selflessly donated their time and potentially their funds – market creators post a bond in the platforms native rep tokens, which they lose if a market is deemed \"invalid\" because the outcome cannot be verified – all just to brighten their fellow users days.in no particular order, here are a few of the weirdest markets on augur today.vitaliks girlfriendvitalik buterin, creator of ethereum, the worlds second-most valuable blockchain, enjoys the kind of wealth and notoriety few 24-year-olds have.but does he have a girlfriend? and if not now, when?these questions have vexed the crypto community enough to spawn a dedicated article – one thats apparently been viewed over 18,000 times. and now, indelibly etched into buterins own creation, theres an augur market for it too.buterin himself must confirm the relationship, according to the markets terms, and the couple must have been together for at least one full day.its worth noting here that (as with many augur markets) nobody has bet on this one at the time of writing.are you there, god?ostensibly, augur markets must be based on verifiable events, but augur is a platform without moderators, so thats become more of a guideline.as mentioned above, the perfect example: someone has posed the question, \"does god exist?\"theyre apparently in no hurry to find out, as the market expires at the beginning of 2020. and the resolution source must be the \"news media.\"the heathen users that initiated the market give the creator of the universe a 10 percent chance of existing. no money is at stake at the time of writing.safu or not safunaturally, augur users havent passed up on the chance to sprinkle the platform with their particular flavor of memes.titled \"funds are safu?\" one market references a bizarre – but popular – youtube send-up of binance ceo changpeng \"cz\" zhaos attempt to reassure users that their crypto holdings on the platform were safe.looking at the markets details, however, it appears not to be a joke, but a serious – if vaguely worded – question about whether binance will be hacked: \"will the security of https://www.binance.com/ be negatively affected such that there is a newsworthy loss of money?\"the market expired without any bets having been placed.does not computecompetition is stiff, but the trolliest market currently active on augur may well be this restatement of the liar paradox – the sort of query one might use to incapacitate a murderous supercomputer.for the uninitiated, the statement \"this sentence is false\" is a paradox because, if the statement is, in fact, false, that means it checks out. so its true.if the statement is true – by being false – then it violates its own premise: it has to be false.thinking about this paradox goes back to at least the fourth century bce, making it one of humanitys longest-running time wasters. adding a pinch of circular meta-salt to this concoction, the market creator made the point of reference for this market predictions.global, a site that scrapes data from augur.the pee tapethe allegation that russian authorities possess compromising material on u.s. president donald trump is one of the stranger stories to emerge from the 2016 election.the existence of this compromising material – originating from a collection of documents prepared by a former british intelligence officer working (indirectly) on behalf of democrats – is often known as the \"pee tape\" due to its alleged content.but it hasnt been proven.judging by an augur market on the topic, though, chances are around one in four that such a tape will emerge before the end of trumps first term.betting volume on the market has been very low, however, at the equivalent of less than $60.mcafees bold predictionmany of the most liquid and valuable markets on augur deal with the prices of cryptocurrencies.so at first glance, its hard to see whats remarkable about one particular market predicting that the price of bitcoin will pass $1 million before 2020.but theres a clue in the fact that its tagged \"mcafee.\"the anti-virus-software-creator-turned-cryptocurrency-hype-man has published many inadvisable tweets. topping the list, however, is one from late 2017, when he predicted that bitcoin would hit $1 million and reiterated a promise hed made earlier to \"eat my dick on national television\" if he proved incorrect.yet another augur market gets to the, um, meat of

today. it gets even worse when you look at a wider time frame.turkey, one of the biggest countries in terms of population ( #19 ) and in terms of economic power ( #13 ), is experiencing a serious economic crisis, which is mostly fueled by the current politics.usually when a country messes up the economy, the central bank will try to stabilize the currency and contain the crisis, while taking massive losses, until they eventually run out of power and give in. this causes the value of their currency to start rapidly decreasing. this is happening to turkey and the citizens are aware of it. turkey has a history of having an economic crisis every decade and the older citizens remember converting all their paychecks into usd or gold as soon as they got them because of hyperinflation. this crisis was a bit overdue and a lot of economists were expecting it.a lot of turkish citizens just started to realize that turkey has entered a “bear market”. no one wants to keep turkish lira, people are panicking and they want to exchange it for usd, or gold as soon as possible. if this bear market continues for another 6 months to a year turkish citizens will convert most of their savings into other currencies.however the local media are manipulating the numbers and giving false information about the economical situation of the country. also it seems like some banks are not allowing the citizens to buy foreign currencies, though they allow them to sell foreign currencies. this trend might spread to other banks and eventually the citizens will only have gold as a safe place to store their wealth. while gold is an excellent long term store of wealth, it does pose some problems when the whole nation is trying to buy it: there isn’t enough gold for everyone, resulting in massive price increases in a small geographical area.3 year timeline - 1 gram gold to turkish lira graphso, buying foreign currencies are discouraged by the governments and banks, there isn’t enough gold volume for everyone-how will the citizens of turkey store their wealth?the answer is digital gold: bitcoinit seems we are seeing the beginning of the bitcoin trend: while most cryptocurrency exchanges have lost significant amount of volume after january, exchanges in turkey have started to gain volume in the last few months. while the turkish banks are displeasing customers, turkish cryptocurrency exchanges are offering them a way out.let’s explore what might happen if this trend continues for a few quarters.bitcoin 24h volume is $4bethereum 24h volume is $1.5bturkey’s gdp per capita is $10.7kturkey population is 80mturkey internet users are 53mapparently 31% of south korean workers have invested on average 3 months worth of salary into cryptocurrencies. while koreans are fast adopters in technology, turks are fast adopters in methods to transfer try into other currencies. turks also have an entrepreneurial risk taking culture and are very interested in making easy money via ponzi schemes and other means. furthermore turks are hodling about $200b worth of gold under their pillows. keeping private keys under a pillow is the digitization of this tradition. there is also a research by ingbank that indicates 18% of young turkish professionals own bitcoin.if 20% (10.6m) of those internet users in turkey decided to put 3 months worth of salary into bitcoin, that would mean $28.3b money entering the cryptocurrency market, slowly, consistently over time. at this time bitcoin has a market cap of $111b and another $28b entering will increase the market cap by $100b-$500b. about 10% or $10b of bitcoins are actively traded. if $25b were to enter into a $10b market, the price is likely to triple taking the market cap to around $350b. this happens because of the gap between inflow and market cap.if turkish people start using cryptocurrencies, the price of bitcoin and every other cryptocurrency will increase significantly. this will result in technical analysts and trading algorithms getting bullish signals about the market and causing them to invest too. this will cause media all over the world to get interested in bitcoin prices again, resulting in new people getting into it. initial coin offerings, youtubers, bloggers, will have more money to spend on marketing and they will reach a lot more people.this cycle of events could eventually lead to the biggest economic bubble humanity has ever experienced.or none these may happen because the turkish government might start “discouraging” the purchase of cryptocurrencies too. oh wait they already have:turkey’s central bank @centralbank_tr made an infographic video on cryptocurrenciesmaybe we shouldn’t allow countries the luxury of screwing up their economies and then locking up their citizens money.social media gave us the freedom of communication, cryptocurrencies will give us financial freedom. let’s embrace it.', 'markets are meek today; monero, lisk, and nano inch up, bitcoin

crypto markets have dumped 28%, or over $80 billion so there is a long way to go for them to be considered bullish once again.bitcoin dominance has climbed to 53.6% which is close to its highest level this year and largely at the expense of ethereum which has been murdered in recent weeks.fomo moments is a section that takes a daily look at the top 25 altcoins during the current trading session and analyses the best performing ones, looking for trends and possible fundamentals.', 'the situation of the cryptocurrency market in the eyes of sergey petrik, the co-founder of umcumc unifies professionals with years of experience in smm marketing, pr, project management and software development. moreover, every member of the umc team is an active participant in the cryptocurrency market and has his / her own view on all the events.today we present to you the article of sergey petrik, the co-founder and chief sales officer of the umc project, on the situation in the cryptocurrency market. the article is based on sergey’s personal podcast in cryptotime.sergey called his new podcast “depression”, because no one knows what we should expect on the cryptocurrency market in the near future. he shared his thoughts on the most important events of the cryptocurrency market, the prospects of growth and the future of crypto world. we should consider the opinion of crypto experts and follow the news.the 3rd monthly report of the chinese gov for its cryptocurrency rating index was released recently. despite having banned icos and crypto trading in september 2017, china’s ministry of industry & information technology has launched a rating index. eos is positioned again first and leading while ethereum follows second. the ranking puts a new cryptocurrency komodo in the top 5 blockchain platforms. thus, i believe that it is worth investigating komodo in more details.i think that the cryptocurrency market will start growing again in september-october 2018. many analysts claim that 2017 was almost identical with this year. in summer 2017, all crypto forecasts were pessimistic and a few people believed in cryptocurrency. at the same time, an ico boom also took place in summer 2017. many users have invested in icos, which had a huge profit. i believe that this scenario will happen again.vitalik buterin, the co-founder of ethereum, believes that the value of cryptocurrency may be seen in regular, small-scale everyday spending. in a private event in san francisco last week, he spoke on the future of cryptocurrencies, remarking that he would be happy to pay for goods and services with bitcoin cash. i do not know whether buterin has ever met roger vere, but his statement will definitely cause resonance. every statement of opinion leaders and crypto gurus has a very strong influence on the crypto market. buterin also mentioned that he believes icos to be “old and boring”, past their prime as a financing model.currently it is very difficult to work on the ico market. as you may know, i am the co-founder of umc, the project which is coming to the ico market in the near future. our team has already finished a pre-sale and a closed round of the token sale. in september 2018 we plan to launch a public token sale. that’s when we plan to present our project capabilities, mvp, partners. umc is the story of a real business. we plan to create the first advertising exchange in social messengers. you can order any advertisement in the world’s top messengers (viber, whatsapp, telegam and others) and use the technology of smart contracts on the umc platform. umc will act as guarantor of the transaction between the buyer and the advertiser. today this niche is very promising; we will solve many problems related to guarantors, copyright, discount token, etc.moreover, each state will introduce its own national cryptocurrency very soon. state representatives all around the world are considering the possibility of creating their national cryptocurrency: study blockchain and its applicability in a real life, gather a team of professionals. sooner or later they will create a model that will be applicable in different countries. perhaps it will be swiss or maltese model. malta is considered to be the silicon valley for cryptocurrencies.today, most bitcoins are bought outside the exchange. we do not see much of the turnover, even coinmarketcap does not show real numbers and does not add a lot of coins. on coinmarketcap you can find 2000 currencies, while there are more than 10 000 on a real market. many new exchanges appear on the market. i think that there will be many exchanges like binance on the market, which will make a real revolution.the representatives of wolf street believe that bitcoin is a good way to store money. bitcoin does not have any other functions. the psychological barrier of $6,000 is very important. if bitcoin’s price falls below $6,000, then this will be an important psychological factor.now i’m drawing a positive picture of the cryptocurrency market. technologically, this will be the most correct approach, because during the dot.com collapse, when 90 percent of companies ceased to exist, the remaining 10 percent — google, amazon, yahoo survived and brought their holders a huge profit.', 'wednesday, august 22, 2018 at 8:57amdecentralized systems will continue to lose to centralized systems until theres a driver requiring decentralization to deliver a clearly superior consumer experience. unfortunately, that may not happen for quite some time.i say unfortunately because ten years ago, even five years ago, i still believed decentralization would win. why? for all the idealistic technical reasons i laid out long ago in building super scalable systems: blade runner meets autonomic computing in the ambient cloud.while the internet and the web are inherently decentralized, mainstream applications built on top do not have to be. typically, applications today—facebook, salesforce, google, spotify, etc.—are all centralized.that wasnt always the case. in the early days of the internet the internet was protocol driven, decentralized, and often distributed—ftp (1971), telnet (<1973), finger (1971/1977), tcp/ip (1974), uucp (late 1970s) nntp (1986), dns (1983), smtp (1982), irc(1988), http(1990), tor (mid-1990s), napster(1999), xmpp(1999), and [email protected](1999).we do have new decentalized services: bitcoin(2009), minecraft(2009), ethereum(2014), ipfs(2015), mastadon(2016), dat (2018), and peertube(2018). were still waiting on pied piper to deliver the decentralized internet.on an evolutionary timeline decentralized systems are neanderthals; centralized systems are the humans. neanderthals came first. humans may have interbred with neanderthals, humans may have even killed off the neanderthals, but theres no doubt humans outlasted the neanderthals.the reason why decentralization came first is clear from a picture of the very first arpa (advanced research projects agency) network, which later evolved into the internet we know and sometimes love today:where wizards stay up lateeveryone had a vision of the potential for intercomputer communication, but no one had ever sat down to construct protocols that could actually be used. it wasn’t bbn’s job to worry about that problem. the only promise anyone from bbn had made about the planned-for subnetwork of imps was that it would move packets back and forth, and make sure they got to their destination. it was entirely up to the host computer to figure out how to communicate with another host computer or what to do with the messages once it received them. this was called the “host-to-host” protocol. -- where wizards stay up lateall that existed were hosts talking directly to each other over a primitive network. centralization didnt exist. tcp/ip didnt exist. nothing we take for granted today existed.this fit the design goals. the early internet was all about sharing data:taylor had been the young director of the office within the defense department’s advanced research projects agency overseeing computer research, and he was the one who had started the arpanet. the project had embodied the most peaceful intentions—to link computers at scientific laboratories across the country so that researchers might share computer resources. ... building a network as an end in itself wasn’t taylor’s principal objective. he was trying to solve a problem he had seen grow worse with each round of funding. researchers were duplicating, and isolating, costly computing resources. not only were the scientists at each site engaging in more, and more diverse, computer research, but their demands for computer resources were growing faster than taylor’s budget. every new project required setting up a new and costly computing operation. ... and none of the resources or results was easily shared. if the scientists doing graphics in salt lake city wanted to use the programs developed by the people at lincoln lab, they had to fly to boston. -- where wizards stay up lateback in those days of high adventure hosts were far more than mere pets, they were golden temples where crusaders came to worship speaking prayers of code.today, servers arent even cattle, servers are insects connected over fast networks. centralization is not only possible now, its economical, its practical, its controlable, its governable, its economies of scalable, its reliable, its walled gardenable, its monetizable, its affordable, its performance tunable, its scalable, its cacheable, its securable, its defensible, its brandable, its ownable, its right to be forgetable, its fast releasable, its debuggable, its auditable, its iterable, its easier to usable, its easier to onboardable, its copyright checkable, its gdprable, its safe for china searchable, its machine learnable, its monitorable, its spam filterable, its value addable.depending on your point of view, decentralization is few of those things. and many of those \"features\" are exactly why we like decentralization in the first place.whats more, consumers simply do not care. users use. only a small percentage have the technical sophistication to understand why they may want to preferentially use decentralized applications for technical reasons. saying \"its like x, but decentralized\", does not resonate, especially when the services are not as good. we had decentralized slack way before slack...yet theres slack. you know its bad when github managed to recentralize an inherently distributed system like git.there are certainly niche reasons to use decentralized systems, permissionless anonymity being the primary use case. can you trust the likes of facebook or google? history says absolutely not. but most people dont care.what might constitute a turning point back to decentralization? i can think of several:complete deterioration of trust such that avoiding the centralization of power becomes a necessity. radically cheaper cost basis. it becomes fashionable. the decentralization community manages to create clearly superior applications as convenient and reliable as centralized providers. geographical isolation. neanderthals live alongside humans. parallel, separate, not worrying about whos equal.(1) seems more possible than id like to admit. see chinas digital dystopia.(2) still on the horizon. cloud computing will follow the same downward cost curves as everything else.(3) well have to get the kardashians on that.(4) will be difficult. by their very nature iterably improving decentralized applications is like herding cats. its much easier to add features to centralized applications. sure, napster was a great way to share music, but isnt spotify simply better? yes, i know, spotify can shutdown tomorrow and then where are we? im with you. but most arent.(5) the problem is the earth is too small. global centralized applications are buildable today. something i missed on completely. when we go to space that wont be the case. applications in the space age will have to redecentralize...at least until the ansible is invented.(6) we have genetic material from the neanderthals. we can rebuild them. we have the technology. this time maybe its enough that neanderthals survive alongside humans, not going extinct, ready for the time when humans need a fresh infusion of genetic material...or when neanderthals become alpha.so thats what i believe now that i didnt five years ago. how about you?related articles', 'despite all the political talk about 1% and 99%, the economy is more like 10% and 90%, with plenty of professionals such as doctors, programmers, executives and creative people who do pretty well in that 10%. this chapter is about how to be in the 10% and not stuck in the 90% low paid gig economy. this book will help with the bottom of that venn diagram, figuring out where the puck is headed, so that you can get on the right side of the disruptive changes coming during the blockchain economy.this is part five of the blockchain economy serialised book. part five is where we focus on working in the blockchain economy – whether as an employee or contractor. part 5 only has one chapter because we refer back to parts 1, 2, 3 and 4. also we have no ambition to write generally about career/work advice; this is specific to working in the blockchain economy. for the index/table of contents of the blockchain economy book please click here.the book is now in the editing process. if you would like to be an early reviewer and help shape the final version before it goes on sale, please send an email to bernard at dailyfintech dot com.this chapter covers 5 key questions that employees or contractors need to ask:are you entering or re-entering the workforce or a nervous incumbent?where is your market in the creative destruction 7 act play?where are the agile incumbents with proven ability to ride disruptive waves?where is the intersection of those 3 circles?how to be a contractor with clout after disruption hits your employer?are you entering or re-entering the workforce or a nervous incumbent?if you are entering workforce from school or college, you may have about 40 years of work ahead of you and hit your peak earnings years in about 10 years.the main advice to somebody entering the workforce is don’t sweat it, because nobody can predict what the future of work will be like, but also don’t listen to anybody who is only telling you where the puck is today. 40 years ago nobody predicted most of the jobs that we do today, somebody urging you to get into a business that is hot today, may not be helping you think about what the world pf work will be in about 10 years time when you are hitting your peak earnings years. assuming you don’t want to be an entrepreneur and start your own venture (if you do, please read part 4), the best advice is to work for a great entrepreneur. at what stage you choose to work for that entrepreneur will depend on your risk appetite. at one end of the risk appetite you want to be an early employee and make a fortune from success compensation (such as stock options and tokens). if that is your appetite you need to think more like an entrepreneur and so you should read part 4. beware of survivorship bias. for every story of early employees making fortunes at a places like google and facebook are 100x of stories of those who worked for less than market rates who made very little on success compensation. so you must think like an investor, because you are investing your time. you need to build a portfolio over your working life. at the other end of the risk spectrum is somebody who just wants a good paycheck and benefits, which means working for a big established firm. the only trick there is making sure your big established firm is not slap bang in path of the disruption (e.g. working at blockbuster when streaming video was going mainstream).if you are re-entering workforce after raising children, being laid off, a sickness or some other life event, the key issue to navigate is how to leverage your great experience of how things work today when everything is changing so fast. you want to find a company that:is late enough to pay you properly. you don’t want to be earlier than act 3 – that is too high risk for your life-stage.early enough that they value your legacy knowledge. in the earlier acts, your legacy knowledge is hugely valuable to the founding team, much less so in the later acts.so, in the earlier acts you take on more risk but have potentially more reward – just like an investor.if you are employed in a big established firm but you have the nasty feeling that your employer is facing disruption – welcome to the world of the nervous incumbent. for example, you do not want to be at kodak when digital films hit the market or at blockbuster when streaming movies came along. the advice to nervous incumbents is to jump before you are pushed. it is much easier to get good work if you leave before the mass layoffs.in all three cases – entering, re-entering or nervous incumbent – you want to have a clear view of where is your market in the creative destruction 7 act play. this book is an aid to your own creative thinking that will help you think through where your market is in the stages of disruption.where is your market in the creative destruction 7 act play?whether you want safety (not getting crushed by a tsunami) or thrills (surfing a big wave) you want to make sure you know where the the wave of change is and where it is headed. one way is to read this book, particularly part 2 where the established markets are described. then look at where is your market in the creative destruction 7 act play.although history does not repeat, it often rhymes. you can spot these patterns throughout the history of disruptive waves of change. we call this cheat sheet the creative destruction 7 act play.creative destruction 7 act play is written from the perspective of the incumbents (which tells the disrupters what to do (see part 4). the creative destruction 7 act play helps you to spot where your market is today.act 1. the old guard dominate.this is when a few big companies dominate a market that has not fundamentally changed for decades. mergers, debt leveraged acquisitions and “roll-ups” have locked the old guard into behemoth structures. no entrepreneur would think of competing against these companies and, if they did, no investor would back them. with so many waves of changing hitting at the same time (blockchain + ai + iot + mobile etc), there are very few markets like this any more and it depends on how you frame the market. for example, the oil business is in act 1, but if you view the oil business as one segment of the energy market, it is more like acts 4 and 5. for those entering the workforce, this is to be avoided. for the nervous incumbents, only act now if you have a compelling alternative, there is no immediate threat. for those reentering the workforce, these behemoths can still survive for 10+ years so if that is your time horizon they can be a good bet, but be aware that rehiring laid off executives as consultants/contractors will be your competition.act 2. straws in the wind. this is when a few visionary/crazy entrepreneurs see opportunity. occasionally vcs get active at this stage, but all too often vcs are part of the established order and do not see enough reason to believe that the times are changing. it takes guts to see a few straws blowing about and bet that this is caused by an invisible wind. the signs of change are far from obvious but “the answer my friend is blowing in the wind”. this is where icos, a blockchain innovation, is changing early stage capital and that is further accelerating change because it is easier now to raise capital at this stage. bitcoin, for example, was in this phase around 2011 and ethereum was in act 2 in 2014. for those entering the workforce, act 2 is great if you can work for a great entrepreneur. for the nervous incumbents, this is an early warning sign and you should get out now if you are reasonably young. for those reentering the workforce, act 2 is good if you can find a great entrepreneur who will value (pay for) your experience of how the market works today.act 3. denial. the changes are now real and the old guard management can see it, but they don’t know how to react so they reach for high pressure management to make the numbers work. in some cases, management also reach for creative accounting tricks to smooth out earnings and make it look as if nothing has changed (known as fraud in most circles). this act can go on a long time as most investors work on surface numbers. a famous example of the denial act 3 was subprime mortgages that blew up in the global financial crisis in 2008. for a long time the surface numbers looked good until a few nonconformists looked below the surface (watch the big short for an entertaining take on that story). a more recent example in finance was the wells fargo fake accounts scandal (which was going on for a long time before it was uncovered). for those entering the workforce, act 3 is a great entry point; you just need to find a great entrepreneur to work for. for the nervous incumbents, this is where you can see the signs internally that the outside world cannot easily see, so it can be a great time to act. for those reentering the workforce, avoid the incumbents in this phase as their behaviour will be unpredictable; it will all look calm on the surface, while the reality is chaos.act 4. the weird turn pro. the crazy entrepreneurs who started at act 2 are now gaining real traction and major amounts of capital. they are experimenting frenetically to find what is really sustainable/scalable. this is the time “when the going gets weird, the weird turn pro” (quote from hunter s thompson, who was certainly weird but also professional enough to write best-selling books). during this act there are lots of stories in the media about these strange entrepreneurs but, as the old guard numbers still appear to be ok, the accepted wisdom is still that nothing will fundamentally change. for those entering the workforce, act 4 is the best risk-adjusted entry point. for the nervous incumbents, you may already be too late; keep an eye out for the mass layoffs heading your way. for those reentering the workforce, the entrepreneurs who are weird turned pro are ideal clients/employers; they have the budget to pay you and know that the devil/god is in the details that you know.act 5. blow up. this is when reality can no longer be glossed over. this is when we see scandals such as wells fargo fake accounts and news corp phone hacking. this can lead to investors taking a cold hard look at the numbers and when the new numbers do finally appear, it can trigger a stock crisis, often with a restatement of earnings and a change of ceo.at this stage the reality can no longer be denied and we see real crises in big companies. these crises may lead to radical transformation, or they may lead to chapter 11 restructuring and fire sales. before that happens we see the kind of behavior we just saw with wells fargo (which went on a long time during act 3, denial, when hardly anybody was paying attention). this is new for banking, which has not had a major headwind like this in hundreds of years. however, bankers can study other markets that got hit by the digitization truck – for example media. when corporate pressure hits reality, we get act 5 blowup. for those entering the workforce, act 5 is a bit late but there are very good jobs on the right side of disruption. for the nervous incumbents, this is already too late, just get the best lay off terms you can. for those reentering the workforce, there are a lot of opportunities among those scaling fast.act 6. reconstruction. this is when a new power structure starts to emerges. this is when we see ipos from the visionary entrepreneurs who started in act 2. sometimes they stumble post ipo and never recover. sometimes they stumble post ipo, recover and grow to strength – that was the famous story of priceline after the dot com nuclear winter. for those entering the workforce, act 6 is good if you want a relatively low risk job; the companies that started in act 2 are now hiring a lot and have decades of high earning years ahead of them. for the nervous incumbents, this defines your job search. for those reentering the workforce, it is hard but not impossible to show value for your legacy experience.act 7.the new incumbents. many entrepreneurs make the mistake of seeing how quickly the new guard arose and think that they can also be deposed quickly. the entrepreneurs who made it to this stage will be tenacious, paranoid and really hard to beat – until the next wave comes along. for example, in the centralized internet era we have gafa (google, apple facebook, amazon) and bat (baidu alibaba tencent) who deposed analog media and bricks and mortar retailers and will dominate until the decentralized internet gets to prime time. until that happens, don’t bet against gafa and bat. for those entering the workforce, act 7 is low risk/low reward. for the nervous incumbents, your target list of future employers is smaller and each has a tough hiring process. for those reentering the workforce, the new incumbents will pay for specific knowledge/experience but there is little upside.where are the agile incumbents with proven ability to ride disruptive waves?there is a myth that incumbents always lose to startups during waves of disruptive change. when you look at what actually happened, you usually see a really dumb move by an incumbent that snatched defeat from the jaws of victory and gave the market to the startup. the two most famous stories are:ibm handing the pc market to microsoft. ibm did not understand that the real value creation was in the software operating system.blockbuster handing the streaming video market to netflix. blockbuster did not understand that netflix in those days was quite vulnerable and could be easily acquired or crushed.there are very few companies with a proven ability to ride disruptive waves. one is the aforementioned ibm. having learned their lesson from losing the pc market to ibm, the great turnaround under lou gerstner put in place the the culture that ensured customer-centricity no matter what the wave of disruption was. now ibm is a big player in ai, blockchain and iot, while keeping a laser focus on serving enterprise customers and having crystal clear financial metrics to judge their performance and to guide capital allocation.you can see the same in intel and goldman sachs. what all three have in common is a succession process where the right ceo emerges to ride the next wave of disruptive change.there are very few companies like this. a more common story emerges from companies such as yahoo and aol, which struggled to thrive after a new wave of disruptive change hit them.as an employee, assume that most incumbents will be hurt by disruptive change, no matter what the pr machine says; but you can bet on the few that have proven ability, across multiple ceos, to ride disruptive waves.where is the intersection of those 3 circles?although charles handy wrote the empty raincoat (making sense of the future) empty in 1995 at the dawn of the digital age, he describes the changes coming to our society very well and handy rightly bears the title of visionary. this quote is timeless:“the empty raincoat is to me, the symbol of our most pressing paradox. if economic progress means that we become anonymous cogs in some great machine, then progress is an empty promise.”or as a t shirt proclaims “the matrix was a documentary”.the takeaway from the empty raincoat is that you should do work that you love, that is fulfilling for you. however the old line about “do what you love and the money will follow” is too simplistic on its own. just ask many a struggling musician, actor, writer or artist. on the other hand, getting a lot of money for work that you hate so that you can be “nothing more than something you invest in” (bob dylan) is not a recipe for a good life. you need work that is in that venn diagram between work you love and work that pays well.the problem is doing that during times of disruptive change. your employer going bankrupt sure impacts the “pays well” part of the venn. that is why you need to look at where the puck is headed, not where it is today. i wrote this book to help answer that question.how to be a contractor with clout after disruption hits your employer?when incumbents get to act 5 in the creative destruction 7 act play there are a lot of layoffs. if you are nearing retirement this can work well. you get a nice severance package and you may get rehired as a consultant on a short term contract.if you are younger and facing mass layoffs, your options are worse. to avoid being a low paid gig economy worker, driving a taxi or doing tasks for those with good jobs, you need to do two things:first, jump before you are pushed. if you see “the writing on the wall” you can be out and into the job market while your experience is still prized. wait till the layoffs and you will be on the wrong side of supply and demand. read this book to see “the writing on the wall” before your colleagues.second, reinvent your personal brand. a linkedin profile is no longer enough. you need to drive your personal brand through all content marketing channel, so that you tell the market what you know.bernard

meeting on youtube august 24 on the progress of client implementation and tests of the enterprise integration patterns (eips) for the upcoming constantinople hard fork.the meeting started with a discussion of the latest updates on the processes of no-proof blockchain tests and the progress achieved on major eth clients, with one of the devs explaining that there is a need to revamp some of the testing to avoid potential consensus issues.this week saw the release of a number of new features; however, the devs noticed one instability with a “huge” major miner rewrite, which is supposed to be solved by the next update. by monday, the devs are planning to push out another release “to have the whole thing completed” and finalize the mining release issue.in terms of the constantinople hard fork, hardly anything has changed for the last two weeks, according to the meeting. the devs reported on several bug fixes and new tweaks for the testnet, also noting that eip-1211 will not be included in the upcoming hard fork.the devs also came to a decision that it is far better for the network to stay on schedule and release new hard forks in time, as opposed to rushing with involving new eips or delaying those ready for implementation at the expense of the ones still under development.speaking about the possibility to have a second hard fork if it is “really hard to get the changes bundled for all eips for constantinople,” one of the devs said:“if we delay the time, we would want more features to this particular [constantinople] hard fork and we should discuss if it’s good to have many changes in one fork, or it’s better to have less changes in many hard forks.”the devs also decided to release new hard forks every eight months after the constantinople hard fork. the proposal of a release every six months was rejected as it would create too much pressure for the devs team.further discussion was devoted to the issue of adding a “difficulty bomb” and its impact on the reduction and maintenance of block rewards. according to the devs, eip-858 would reduce block rewards to 1 eth per block, eip-1234 would reduce block rewards to 2 eth, while eip-1295 would keep rewards to 3 eth but will affect other factors such as the proof-of-work (pow) incentive structure.in order to determine which of the three possible scenarios is preferable, the devs called on the community members. some of the participants pointed out the environmental impact of eth mining, while others insisted on decreasing profitability or even excluding asic miners from the eth network. in the end, the participants in the discussion could not reach common ground, so the devs decided to hold another meeting next week on august 31.as of press time, ethereum is currently trading at around $281, down almost 10 percent on the week and 41 percent on the month.', 'companies kik’s kinit app now lands on ios platformkinit application users can set up the kin wallet in quick simple steps while engaging in intuitive activities to earn kin tokens. users can also access the kin marketplace, comprising of a variety of brands and retailers.after android, kinit app set to rock the ios platformon wednesday, august 22, the kin foundation announced the launch of its kinit application on the ios app store. ios users will be able to earn and spend the kin cryptocurrency natively within the kinit ios application. the kin digital tokens were launched last year by popular messaging service kik through a highly successful $100 million ico.the unique quality of the kinit ios application is the way it allows all blockchain transaction to take place natively within the app. other popular wallets like coinbase don’t provide this facility, instead directing all crypto transactions to their exchange platforms.the kinit application is lightweight, user-friendly, and hosts all the basic features. once the application is downloaded, setting up a kin wallet is just a few steps away. after this, users can engage with interactive quizzes and polls to earn their kin tokens.kin tokens grab a lion’s share on ethereum platformlast month, kik launched the kinit application on google play for android users. the launch has been hugely successful so far, reaching 15000 downloads on the android platform just within a month’s time. currently, kin is the most active digital currency surpassing the number of active users of the entire ethereum’s dapp (decentralized apps) ecosystem.as the kinit app migrates to the ios platform, the number of active kin token users are surely expected to multiply further. to expand the kin ecosystem further, the company recently approved 40 developers as a part of the kin developer program.the kin marketplaceto drive more users to its platform, the kinit application provides incentives in the form of kin tokens for completing survey, polls or solving puzzles. most of the polls are conducted by kik partner swelly, a polling chat bot. the rewards are sponsored by redbull and swarovski, who are currently testing user engagement through digital currencies.being a part of the kin ecosystem also allows users access to the kin marketplace. here they can spend their kin tokens on gift cards from brands — retailers and other channel partners like amc theatres, amazon and google play. additionally, kin token users can also make payments amongst themselves via the kinit app.kik is not the sole player with a vision of integrating digital tokens to its messaging services. behemoths like telegram and facebook are already exploring several avenues on a similar approach.what are your thoughts on kinit’s migration to ios? let us know what you think in the comments below!images courtesy of kin blog, medium,

misunderstood cryptocurrency. in light of this, i have chosen to highlight it once again and expand on my previous claim that kin will be the most used cryptocurrency in the world by more carefully walking through what it takes to achieve this, explaining what kin is, bringing you up to speed on what kin has accomplished since my first article, and adding a deadline, as the confidence around the claim has increased with what we now know.and yes… i’m sure.youbefore continuing, download the kinit app. trust me. earn your first kin (30 seconds) and then follow along with the article. you will get it. *us only.kinit. download it or else.for the newbies: what is kin…i’m going to break this down into steps and walk you through each piece.kin is a currency token.like bitcoin, kin’s main function is the transfer of value between users. it is not designed as a platform for other tokens. unlike bitcoin, it is not a coin, as it is not its blockchain’s own native digital asset. it is an application built on top of another blockchain (actually two, i’ll get to that).kin is not focused on the physical worldthe physical world runs on dollars, and for the most part, it works pretty well. users generally don’t have a problem with this. they get paid in dollars. they spend in dollars. there’s no real demand to fix a problem that users don’t really have. today, if i want to spend bitcoin, i have to purchase bitcoin with usd, spend it on something, and then the merchant has to convert the bitcoin back to usd to pay their bills. it doesn’t make any sense.besides, who wants to spend a currency that could be worth twice as much tomorrow, and who wants to receive a currency that could be worth half as much tomorrow? nobody. and it’s not for a lack of trying. we have been trying to get people to buy their coffee with bitcoin for a decade.“it’s not a technological problem. it’s not a user experience problem. it’s a logical problem.” — ted livingstonkin is concentrating on the digital world. instead of spending kin on things that have a dollar value, kin is being assigned to things without an inherent dollar value, like stickers, chat themes, a quality group chat, digital weapons and armor, other unlockables, and other abstract digital goods and services.you don’t think about the exchange rate of usd/yen whenever you purchase goods, and you shouldn’t when spending kin either. so essentially, kin is kickstarting a new digital economy as the internet’s native currency.kin is an ecosystem token.you’ve probably figured this out by now, but i have to drill it in because there is a mis-kin-ception that kin is only a “kik-token.”kin is not just kikkik is a billion dollar established tech company that created the kin token and is using it in their app, but it is not only used in kik. kik is merely the launch pad.it’s also important to note that kin is a decentralized currency in an ecosystem of centralized apps. decentralized consumer apps suck, frankly. centralized kik is better than decentralized kik. centralized snapchat is better than decentralized snapchat. and at the end of the day, mainstream users don’t care about decentralization, if they even know what it means. all they care about is fast, frictionless, interesting features, and a great user experience. we can improve on that experience by aligning the incentives of the app developers with their users via a decentralized currency shared between apps, and i will explain how.you can earn it .like bitcoin, you can earn kin. but the ways you can earn it are different.bitcoin is brilliant. it offers everyone an equal opportunity to get rewarded for their contributions. everyone plays by the same rules of the game, and everyone is fairly rewarded in a trustless way. bitcoin rewards miners for the computing power they contribute to solving an arbitrary math problem. effectively, you are rewarded with bitcoin for burning electricity.damn, yobut what if we could take the same concept of fairly rewarding contributions, and instead of burning electricity, we reward value creation?kin has the kre.kin has a decentralized incentive protocol to drive mainstream adoption — something that no other cryptocurrency in the world has. it’s called the kin rewards engine (kre).instead of inflating the supply by rewarding miners for burning electricity, kin inflates via value creation. developers of apps who adopt kin are incentivized to create new features and experiences in their apps to maximize the transaction volume in kin through user-to-user interaction. the kre pays out a fixed amount of kin each day and divides it up proportionally to each app in the ecosystem based on the transaction volume that they generated. read that one more time and then continue.kin is a fundamentally new way to monetize.now that developers can be paid via the kre, their incentives are aligned with their users. this means developers no longer have to show their users advertisements or steal and sell their data to make money. they can make money simply by making a great user experience, and their users can even be rewarded for contributing valuable content. and now, for the first time ever, app developers can work together as a collective unit to compete with facebook and google, who monopolize the advertising model of monetization and “copy and crush” everyone else.…and how do we know it will be the most used crypto by the end of the year?to answer this question, we first need to know what it takes to be the most used crypto:currently, the most-used cryptocurrency in the world is steem. it has ~60,000 daily active users (dau) and does ~1.2 million tx/day.that’s it.no really, that’s it.pitiful, right?a decade of blockchain technology and this is what we have to show for it.okay, cut to the chase.kin is being adopted by a ton of apps, several of which have active users in the millions.kik alone has 15 million mau , which translates to a few million active users per day., which translates to a few million active users per day. imvu has 5 million mau. they even have a growing active marketplace for content creators built into the app already.on top of these, there are forty (read: 40) other apps that are adopting kin this october, and will be live in the app stores. you can check them all out here. this is courtesy of the kin developer program, and this is not the only one. there will be a second batch, perhaps before the end of the year, where developers will have a shot at being early adopters of the currency and rewarded with approximately $120k each (going by the first one). of these apps, nearby has over 5 million downloads on android, and several other apps have hundreds of thousands of downloads. this is only the beginning.there is also the kinit app that you hopefully already downloaded. this is sort of like the main hub and wallet, where you can discover the other apps in the ecosystem and use it as just one of many places to earn some kin in exchange for your time. it also has a few spend options. more spend options will exist in the future, but for now, you’ll have to settle for amazon gift cards and the like (wow that really sucks).current standingkin currently has over 9000! dau.this is more than all ethereum dapps combined (really setting the bar high…). that is how pitiful cryptocurrency is in the eyes of mainstream adoption. almost all of these active users are just from the kinit app. kin is also available in kik, but it’s in private beta, and not many users have access to it. of the users that do have access to it, they only have chat themes as a spend option. kik is quickly improving the experience with an agile and iterative approach to meet market fit as quickly as possible. “move like the wind.”soon, kik will be open to the public, fit with all the bells and whistles it needs, and kinit will begin to go global as they exit the public beta stage and adapt the user experience beyond users in the us, beginning with canada and expanding into europe and asia.deep breath. furthermore, kin is developing an sdk with unity to bring kin to mobile game developers and quickly expand the ecosystem.all of this together absolutely shatters the current most-used record. and what’s more impressive is that it will be by mainstream consumers, not crypto enthusiasts.“i have been involved with kin since the early stages of the project in 2017, as it continues along the path to become the cryptocurrency for consumer apps. kin has a unique value proposition, as it unlocks new growth and monetization strategies for developers, and based on its first integrations, i truly believe that kin will drive mainstream consumer adoption of cryptocurrency.”-william mougayar, former special advisor to the ethereum foundationyou forgot to talk about the two blockchains thingright. so a big part about being the most used cryptocurrency in the world is that you need a blockchain that can handle it. currently, ethereum cannot handle it alone. it’s not fast, it’s not nearly scalable enough (kin alone would crash it instantly), and it’s not cheap enough. but it does have two good qualities: it has liquidity, and it is decentralized and secure.to complete the puzzle, kin forked the stellar blockchain to create a scalable, fast, and fee-less blockchain. stellar-fork kin is placed in the app for users, and they are creating an atomic swap to the erc20 kin to get the best of both worlds.a quick note on potential “competitors”steem, mithril, bat, reddcoin (lol), and others like this are kind of similar to kin. but not really.steem is a single platform coin with nowhere to grow. mithril is also a single platform token, no installed base of users, and still doesn’t help developers monetize. bat has an installed base of users on brave, but it’s not user friendly (none of these “competitors” are). also, bat wants to pay users for watching ads. kin is creating a new way to monetize without ads. it’s just not the same. bat is counting on your mom and dad, brother, and sister to enable ads in their browser and watch them for money instead of just using an ad blocker and continuing with their lives. bat also doesn’t create blockchain wallets for you. they just give you bat that you can store in your own wallet that you create yourself (consumer experience nightmare). do i have to touch on reddcoin? kin is really the only horse in this race. compare the user experience of the kinit app (have you downloaded it yet…? seriously, 30 seconds. come on.) to this:the nightmarenobody has a reward system like the kre. nobody has an installed user base anywhere as large as kin’s by a long shot. nobody has a scalable blockchain for mainstream consumer apps. nobody has a system of getting apps to work together to compete against the monopolies, and align the incentives of the developers and their users. nobody else is in the race.you’re still reading?so there you have it. by the end of the year, kin is going to dwarf the crypto space (there are only about 6 million active crypto users total). with millions of users earning and spending kin in an ecosystem of apps, kin will have more utility and demand than any other cryptocurrency. period.look out for the headlines.', 'aaron wright joins denise

price slump. his optimistic views on the future of bitcoin come as he moves away from reddit and towards more venture capital initiatives, including investments in cryptocurrencies and cryptocurrency companies.following the acquisition of reddit by conde nast parent company, advance publications, ohanian has been slowly relieving himself of his day-to-day duties at the online platform. the 35-year old is now looking towards investing in more cutting-edge technologies, including instacart, and self-driving car company cruise. he has also been moving further into the cryptocurrency industry, acquiring a sizable amount of bitcoin as well as an investment in cryptocurrency exchange coinbase.ohanian is optimistic about his investments on both a fiscal and personal level, explaining that his new job as the head of his venture capital firm, initialized capital, allows for better family discussion with his wife, tennis star serena williams.while speaking about initialized capital, ohanian said:“i’ve wanted for a long time to get back to early stage founders to being the ‘first check’ in initialized. it’s a lot of fun, frankly. i get to come home and have really good dinner table conversations about the things i did at work, and it’s always [about] meeting new founders, learning about the future and then sometimes rolling up my sleeves.”ohanian bullish on bitcoin and the future of cryptocurrencydespite the current price slump in the cryptocurrency markets, falling from a market capitalization of over $800 billion in january to its yearly low of under $200 billion in august, ohanian is still incredibly optimistic about the future of the cryptocurrency markets.part of his bullishness on crypto is due to the instability of fiat currencies in countries in economic turmoil, saying:“as a store of value, there is some real traction [with bitcoin], and actually as we’re seeing in countries like turkey that are having significant economic crisis — where people are losing faith in the turkish lira — we’re going to see money move over to bitcoin because as unstable as it is, it is actually a lot more stable for a lot of people than their own nations’ fiat currency. but right now, we’re still in the earliest, earliest stages.”ohanian is referencing the overwhelming devaluation of fiat currencies in countries like turkey, who have seen their state-backed currency, the lira, decline in value by 50% since september of 2017 due to economic decline. another country that has been turning to cryptocurrency over their fiat currency is venezuela, who has seen hyperinflation of their fiat currency, the bolivar totaling an estimated 1,000,000% by the end of 2018, according to the international monetary fund.in venezuela, citizens are turning to cryptocurrencies, like dash and bitcoin, to make daily purchases, as no middle man is required to initiate or complete a transaction. dash has seen a meteoric rise in adoption in venezuela, mainly due to a massive marketing campaign in the country.the ceo of the dash core group spoke to business insider about venezuela, saying:“we are seeing tens of thousands of wallet downloads from the country each month… earlier this year, venezuela became our number two market even ahead of china and russia, which are of course huge into cryptocurrency right now.”ohanian doubled down on his bullish statement on the future of cryptocurrencies, explaining that price action doesn’t really matter right now, saying:“no matter what the currency prices are doing, seeing more and more people creating accounts … shows more and more adoption, and their end game is to be this interface between people, their fiat money and crypto — it would be the most user friendly trusted safe secure way to do it. i just encourage people not to get too, too invested in the speculation around the day-to-day trading of the currencies.”featured image from shutterstock.', 'the accused called us residents pretending

the latest cities news, download indian express app', 'advertisementtoday, fundstrat’s tom lee has reaffirmed his $30,000 bitcoin price target by december. but, other permabulls are not as optimistic as lee about the short-term trend of bitcoin.in may, bitmex ceo arthur hayes stated that he would like to see the btc price fall to the $5,000 region before recovering and initiating a 2017-esqe rally to ensure that the market does not expose itself to the creation of a minor bubble.this week, shapeshift ceo erik voorhees and cryptocurrency investor anthony pompliano, better known as pomp, echoed the sentiment of hayes, stating that the bear market of bitcoin is not over just yet.$5,000 before $10,000on cnbc crypto trader, hosted by ran neuner, voorhees, the founder and ceo of major digital asset trading platform shapeshift, said:“i don’t expect it (bear market) to end soon, although i do think that the rate of collapse has slowed considerably. generally in these bubbles, after you go through several months of a downtrend you hang out in a range for a while… but i think we are done with a majority of the collapse.”voorhees offered a relatively enthusiastic viewpoint on the trend of the crypto market, noting that while the bear market of bitcoin has evidently not ended, the worst part of the correction has slowed down.last week, researchers at diar reported that the rate of bitcoin’s volatility has dropped to a 14-month low, as btc demonstrated stability in the mid-$6,000 range since august 6, for around three weeks.as seen in previous 80 percent corrections and rallies in 2012, 2014, and 2017, bitcoin has traditionally required a period of stability before initiating a large rally on the upside.hence, the btc price demonstrating stability in the range of $6,300 to $6,700 over the past three weeks is positive, but the dominant cryptocurrency will need to show months of stability before establishing a strong foundation to support its next big rally.however, pomp has not been as optimistic as voorhees and hayes, as he wrote in his latest newsletter that he sees the price of btc falling to the $3,000 region before recovering to the $10,000 resistance level.“the final data outputs left me with a few uncomfortable conclusions. the most notable one is that we are likely to see bitcoin near $3,000 before we see bitcoin at $10,000 again. if this is true, that means we still have ~50 percent price decrease to go. things may get really, really ugly if this happens,” pomp noted.what happens to bitcoin in december?some analysts see bitcoin falling to $5,000, $4,000, and even $3,000 before recovering. but, most of the analysts share the sentiment that bitcoin will rebound to major resistance levels in the $10,000 to $15,000 range by the end of december.predictions of most experts and analysts in the cryptocurrency space change on a regular basis, as it is difficult to speculate the exact region btc will fall to and recover from. it is important for investors to look at the mid-term trend of bitcoin, analyzing actual metrics like volume and market demand to foresee the future trend of bitcoin.featured image from shutterstockadvertisement', '', 'bitcoin bitcoin price defies sec etf rejection – sign of a maturing market?bitcoin price appears to be little affected by negative news coming out from the sec concerning the possibility of a bitcoin etf.multiple etf rejections not enough to trigger bitcoin selloffsnegative news coming out one minute and btc price 00 taking a tumble the next minute. this was one of the more consistent occurrences in a seemingly unpredictable bitcoin market. everything from exchange hacks to government bans, and coinmarketcap would be dripping red.in recent times, this particular dynamic seems to have changed significantly. a few days ago, the sec denied three btc etf filings and the price of the cryptocurrency barely registered a blip. compare this with the winklevoss etf rejection and the vaneck/solidx etf delay that sent btc price into a tailspin.the sluggish price can be directly tied to the sec bitcoin etf decisions. optimistism and hope that an sec-approved etf would significantly boost btc price culminated in btc reaching $8,400 in late july.market resilience: bear-fatigue or maturing marketas with other occurrences in the market, knowing the reason for an emerging trend is of some importance. the present consensus lies somewhere between “bear-fatigue” and “market maturity” though either might be a bit premature.according to tim enneking, the managing director of crypto asset management, the market has matured to a level where obvious news like the sec btc etf rejection is to be expected. commenting on the matter, enneking said:after the most recent winklevoss rejection, virtually no one expected any of these applications to be approved.brian kelly of bkcm llc has on many occasions predicted that an sec-approved bitcoin etf in 2018 was highly unlikely. for blockforce ceo, eric ervin, the vaneck/solidx etf stands the best chance of receiving the commission’s approval.speaking to forbes, ervin expressed his belief that the market is robust enough to continue is growth and development even as more institutional investors enter the matter.it hasn’t only been doom and gloom for bitcoin and the cryptocurrency market in general over the past two months. in august, intercontinental exchange announced the launch of bakkt, a proposed digital currency trading platform in collaboration with microsoft, starbucks, and other prominent organizations.has the bitcoin market matured? let us know your thoughts in the comment section below.images courtesy of coinmarketcap.com, shutterstock', 'late friday night, elon musk announced that tesla would stay public, less than three weeks after the ceo initially tweeted that he was considering taking the electric-car company private.there were many reasons musk cited for why tesla was “better off as a public company,” but one of them particularly struck me: “there is also no proven path for most retail investors to own shares if we were private,” musk wrote in his official statement.no proven path. of course, he’s right. u.s. financial regulators restrict ownership of shares in startups and other private companies to so-called “accredited investors”—those considered wealthy enough to be able to afford the additional risks that come with owning stock that doesn’t trade on mainstream markets, making it illiquid.but there is one risky investment that retail investors can own no matter how rich (or not) they are: cryptocurrency, obviously. the u.s. securities and exchange commission doesn’t prohibit individuals from buying bitcoin and other digital assets directly—largely because it can’t, due to the decentralized structure of the blockchains on which those cryptocurrencies run. on the other hand, the sec has prevented cryptocurrency from becoming even more widely available—such as it did this week by rejecting the rest of the pending applications for bitcoin exchange-trade funds, or etfs.cryptocurrency, however, is far from “proven” when it comes to offering a responsible way for people to invest and diversify. just check out this week’s “rekt” section for various tales of individuals who lost their savings in cryptocurrency.still, i can’t help thinking that crypto could one day help provide the path that musk is looking for. it’s an idea that came up a couple of weeks ago on our show balancing the ledger, when andra capital’s haydar haba suggested creating a “tesla coin” to solve musk’s problems.there’s still a major obstacle in the way, though: haba and other entrepreneurs offering “security tokens” currently also restrict them to accredited investors in order to stay on the right side of the sec.slava rubin, co-founder and ceo of indiegogo, described on this week’s show how his company only sells its security tokens, usually backed by real estate, to those who prove their accredited status through a verification process. but he also alluded to the way tokenization could open up “a whole

for calling the 2008 financial crisis in a series of articles and presentations starting in 2006. however, roubini is no one trick pony – his research on emerging markets makes him an expert on speculative bubbles of all sorts.it’s no surprise, therefore, that he’s now sticking pins in the entire cryptocurrency/blockchain bubble of bubbles.at last week’s blockshow conference in las vegas, roubini did not mince his words. “there has been a total collapse this year in the cryptocurrency game,” he told an audience largely skeptical of his point of view. “it’s a crypto apocalypse.”deflating bitcoin and all other cryptos as wellnouriel wasted no time poking holes in every bitcoin sacred cow. for example, the claim that bitcoin can serve as money. “bitcoin is not money. to be money it would need to be a unit of account, means of payment, and a stable source of value and purchasing power,” nouriel explained. “bitcoin is none of these. other cryptos are worse.”he contrasted bitcoin and other blockchain-based payment technologies with modern payment systems like paypal , square , and alipay in china. “today’s digital systems are used by millions of people per day, and have nothing to do with blockchain,” he said.bitcoin’s second sacred cow to fall to roubini’s withering arguments: decentralization. “decentralization is a total myth,” roubini explained, as crypto miners (transaction processors), exchanges, developers, and wealth are all in fact centralized.while in theory, anybody can be a crypto miner, successful mining requires immense investment that leads to pooling of mining resources. as a result, “the top five mining pools control 70% of all mining,” roubini pointed out – mostly in places like russia, china, belarus, and other places where organized crime syndicates dominate the crypto world.centralization of wealthcrypto aficionados tout its ability to distribute wealth beyond financial insiders to anyone with a smartphone. the reality, however, is quite different. not only is 99% of crypto trading taking place on a small number of centralized exchanges, but the people with the wealth from such trading are few in number as well.to illustrate the extent that crypto centralizes wealth, roubini referred to the gini coefficient, an economic term that expresses distribution of wealth across a population from 0% (everybody equally wealthy) to 100% (one person has all the wealth.)the gini coefficient for europe, for example, is about 50%. north korea stands at 86%. and bitcoin? how about 88%. “bitcoin wealth is more concentrated than north korean wealth,” roubini pointed out.taking the wind out of tokensas i concluded in my last article, much of the activity around blockchain is nothing more than pathetic sleight-of-hand games with worthless tokens.i’m sure roubini would agree. “a world with thousands of tokens makes zero economic sense,” he said. “tokens are only good for gouging consumers.”if tokens don’t make sense, then it would follow that initial coin offerings (icos) wouldn’t make much sense either. “icos are effectively non-compliant securities,” he said, pointing out that while many ico fans position their ‘coins’ as utility tokens rather than security tokens to avoid securities laws, the reality is that they are in fact securities – and in the us at least, illegal ones.what about smart contracts?ethereum is the second most popular crypto behind bitcoin, likely because it’s possible to run ‘smart contracts’ on the ethereum blockchain. what does roubini think of smart contracts? “they’re neither smart nor contracts,” he said.they are too plagued with hard-to-fix bugs to be smart, and until the lawyers give the thumbs up, the word ‘contract’ is overly optimistic as well.furthermore, even though ethereum has become established in crypto circles, smart contracts – and the distributed apps or ‘dapps’ that leverage them – haven’t amounted to much. “75% of dapps are crypto kitties, ponzi schemes, and casino games,” roubini pointed out.where does that leave blockchain? “a peer-to-peer distributed public ledger is total nonsense,” roubini added – leaving only private, permissioned blockchain solutions with trusted individuals or organizations processing the transactions.when the scammers have milked the crypto insanity for all its worth and they and their marks have all gone home, permissioned blockchain solutions – what i refer to as ‘enterprise blockchain’ – will be all that remains.intellyx publishes the agile digital transformation

harm the booming bitcoin mining business in the state. according to kulr-tv, all the four units of the colstrip coal plant located in rosebud county are expected to shut down by 2027.in senator daines’ view, reliable low-cost energy is necessary for montana to retain and continue attracting new bitcoin mining companies.“as the demand for bitcoin miners increases and supply of cheap, reliable electricity from coal generation decreases, this could pose a threat of the expansion of bitcoin generation and even greater threat to energy supply and prices for montana as a whole,” said senator daines during a u.s. senate energy and natural resources committee meeting.low operating costsbesides the low energy costs, the naturally-cold temperatures have also served to make the state of montana a favorite with bitcoin mining firms, as such an environment reduces cooling expenses. notably, some of the biggest bitcoin mining facilities in north america are located in western montana. this includes cryptowatt llc, which operates a facility located in butte and has an agreement with the colstrip coal plant for the supply of 64mw ,making it one of the biggest users of electricity in the state.there is also the bonner bitcoin data center, which until recently was one of the largest in the world, as ccn reported two months ago. last year, according to the missoula economic partnership, an initiative aimed at promoting business activities in the western montana city of missoula, the bonner facility was expected to expand from the then 12,000 mining rigs to 55,000.project spokanemontana’s pro-cryptocurrency bona fides are also proven by the fact that its state government is the first in the u.s. to offer a grant to a bitcoin mining operation. last year in june, the governor of montana, steve bullock, announced that out of the $1,124,030 that had been allocated as economic development grants to assist main street businesses in creating jobs, training employees, and planning for growth, $416,000 would go to a bitcoin miner named project spokane.“missoula county received $416,000 of bstf job creation funds to assist project spokane, llc to expand, which will allow the company to create 65 new jobs in bonner,” said a press release from bullock’s office. “the bstf funds will be used for purchase of equipment, machinery, furniture and software and for wage reimbursement. project spokane, llc is a data center that provides blockchain security services for the bitcoin network.”featured image from u.s. department of agriculture/flickradvertisement', 'advertisementthis week, the us securities and exchange commission (sec) has said it will review nine bitcoin exchange-traded funds (etfs) it disapproved on august 24.the letter sent to nyse group senior counsel david de gregorio by sec secretary brent fields read:“this letter is to notify you that, pursuant to rule 43 i of the commission’s rules of practice, 17 cfr 20 i .43 1, the commission will review the delegated action. in accordance with rule 431 (e), the august 22 order is stayed until the commission orders otherwise.”community is excited when they shouldn’t bejake chervinsky, a government enforcement defense & securities litigation attorney at kobre kim llp, recently explained in a statement that the revision of the etfs was initiated by sec commissioner hester peirce and that it only takes a single commissioner to order a review.last month, upon the disapproval of the winklevoss bitcoin etf, commissioner peirce expressed her optimism towards etfs and said that bitcoin etfs are worthy enough to hit us markets.according to chervinsky, the ordered revision of the nine etfs is only methodical and the outcome of the revision will lead to the same conclusion the sec disclosed on august 24.he said:“don’t get too excited, folks. under rule 431 of the sec’s rules of practice, it only takes a single commissioner to order a review like this. hester peirce deserves credit & respect for putting up a fight, but there’s no reason to think yesterday’s rejections will be reversed. final thought on bitcoin etfs for the week: the sec’s primary goal is to exercise jurisdiction over crypto markets (by any means necessary). congress hasn’t given them regulatory authority, so they’re essentially trying to coerce etf sponsors into surveilling the market for them.”as ccn previously reported, the nine etfs proposed by proshares and direxion were disapproved due to their dependence on derivatives and the bitcoin futures markets operated by the chicago board options exchange (cboe) and cme group.the two institutions revised their etf proposals to utilize us futures markets as the trusted price of the etf due to the government’s disapproval of the reliance of the winklevoss bitcoin etf on the price listed on us-based cryptocurrency exchange gemini.but, the sec emphasized that the us bitcoin futures market is not large and mature enough to allow institutions to launch etfs on top of the market.the official document released by the sec read:“[the etfs have not met the requirement that a national securities exchange’s rules be designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices. among other things, the exchange has offered no record evidence to demonstrate that bitcoin futures markets are ‘markets of significant size.”same outcomethe sec has clarified on its stance towards derivatives-based bitcoin etfs as it stated that the us futures markets are currently not big enough for etfs to based their price on futures exchanges.whether the sec revises their decision on the rejected bitcoin etfs or not, the argument of the commission on the size of the futures market is relevant and if the futures market itself does not see major improvements or growth in the short-term, derivative-based bitcoin etfs will not be approved.featured image from shutterstock.advertisement', 'few people spent 1938 feeling very playful. even while he tried, the dutch historian johan huizinga confessed that such efforts felt futile: “the fun of playing resists all analysis, all logical interpretation.” his book homo ludens approached games as an awed pilgrim, describing them in terms of myth and ritual. “there is no distinction between marking out a space for a sacred purpose and marking it out for purposes of sheer play,” huizinga wrote. “the turf, the tennis-court, the chess-board and pavement-hopscotch cannot formally be distinguished from the temple or the magic circle.” like holy liturgy, play is “pointless but significant.” huizinga made his own arrogant distinctions, arguing that “savage” societies conflate mimicry with reality—whereas europeans would never get so enthralled by ceremony. i doubt his research took him inside the nearest casino.fixated on the secrecy and mystery of games, huizinga missed their role as public spectacles: when his subjects play, there’s never any money at stake. he wanted to map out impossible territory. chess and roulette are both games, although one involves methodical skill and the other shifts fortunes on a chance bounce. you can play with a piece of chalk or a $2000 computer. none of these definitions are coherent, but they do remain useful. the philosopher ludwig wittgenstein used games as an analogy for his theory of language: we move words around following arbitrary rules, their meaning determined by our shared circumstances, trying to express the indescribable. “if a lion could speak,” he said, “we could not understand him.” imagine teaching that lion how to play poker.or picture a creature bent low against the tundra, with flesh striated like dead bark, as if even the trees were starved for prey. from snowdrifts it feeds on a corpse frozen mid-scream. the first magic: the gathering card i ever saw also came with a quotation, the last words of one saffi eriksdotter, all gothic camp: “ach! hans, run! it’s the lhurgoyf!” i didn’t know what a lhurgoyf was, and i certainly couldn’t decipher any of the symbols or rules on that card, but monsters i understood. i lingered over books full of harpies, demons, and basilisks. when other boys teased me for watching sailor moon, i would protest, not very convincingly, that the show wasn’t girly at all; it had a whole bestiary of monsters, and those belonged to everybody.as a kid i used to get myself in trouble for running onto some neighbour’s porch and exploring the terrain. by middle school i had turned into a fat, awkward dork, not bullied but rather ignored, and i resentfully shunned the world back. magic was a perfect excuse. i spent my allowance money on the lottery of booster packs; i tinkered with decks at the local game shop; i even read the awful tie-in novels, which followed the adventures of a lesser captain riker. (i do love magic’s longest-running villains, the phyrexians, an empire of techno-organic horrors stitching together the borg and the cenobites, with dialogue like: “father of machines! your filigree gaze carves us, and the scars dance upon our grateful flesh.” someone from the storyline team must realize how horny this sounds.)there was never any sudden reckoning, as the subjects of a more tangible addiction might describe. the obsession just exhausted itself. other interests caught my teenage mind, like weird art movies, or sexual confusion, or talking to strangers. for over a decade i barely thought about magic at all, so that when i started playing again last year it felt both familiar and uncanny, like returning to a house amended by generations of owners.*“the question is,” richard garfield once asked, “can systems be dramatic? can math be breathtaking? can numbers move your soul?” when your work involves things like “the distribution of the binomial coefficients modulo p” (his phd thesis), these are cosmic problems, but garfield figured out how to make aesthetics from mathematics. he comes from an unusual family; one great-great-grandfather was james garfield, the president only remembered for getting himself shot by a deranged office-seeker (before gruesomely lingering two more months as america’s finest surgeons prodded the wound). another relative invented the folding milk carton. garfield’s own father was an architect whose job took them across the world, and his lonely son noticed how people would play board games together when they had nothing else in common.the seattle games publisher peter adkison later recalled their first encounter in 1991: “then as now, [garfield] wore mismatched socks, had strange bits of thread and fabric hanging from parts of his clothing and generally looked like someone who had just walked into the salvation army and grabbed whatever seemed colourful.” still a doctoral student at the university of pennsylvania, garfield approached him with the idea for a board game called roborally, but adkison’s new company wizards of the coast had only published traditional rpgs—he feared they didn’t have the resources, and asked to see a simpler concept. garfield realized that you could use trading cards to expand and complicate a universal set of rules. back in pennsylvania he began to mock up prototypes, enlisting friends or strangers as playtesters. garfield wanted every match of magic to feel like a different experience; he thought that people would only buy one or two starter decks each year, discovering unseen cards on the other side of the table. when you read about how those earliest players spent half the time trading pieces of scrap paper, it sounds a little naïve.the cards themselves were more sophisticated: magic’s rules have hardly changed in twenty-five years. simplified here and there, rephrased, but fundamentally consistent. you still start every game with twenty life and a sixty-card library, pulling out an opening hand of seven. each turn you draw one fresh card and get to play a single land, “tapping” them for mana to cast your spells. if you run out of life, typically from creatures attacking it, you lose. instead of nation or species, garfield arranged magic’s factions into five colours, a far more abstract and elegant design. white preaches order, community, and sometimes cruel orthodoxy. blue pursues knowledge as if that can solve everything (a blue mage would definitely respond to personal essays with “citation??”). green’s nature sprites might dance you through flowers or trample you underneath elephants. red passion rouses, liberates, scorches. black admires ambition, but not scruples. wittgenstein once wrote that “i treat colour concepts like the concepts of sensations,” and garfield knew how evocative that palette could be.when magic first went on sale in 1993, the comic book speculator market was starting to collapse, a correction that eventually drove marvel comics into bankruptcy and most of north america’s specialty shops out of business. the remaining stores depended on trading cards and gaming, and magic somehow offered both. titus chalk’s recent book generation decks records how quickly it spread: “a month or two on from release, [wizards of the coast] had grown from five employees to twenty-two. by may 1994, that number had swelled to over fifty. with a recruitment policy dubbed the ‘nearest warm body’ hiring approach, the company ranks were filling with anyone wizards could get their hands on.” in seattle, a city of zine collectors with rock bands, the recruiting favoured vaguely countercultural nerds. years later, one employee described the atmosphere back then: “wizards was a big horny summer camp.”capitalism endures yet remembers nothing, so the comic book bubble only made way for a glut of new card games. there were collectible card games (ccgs) devoted to familiar genre franchises, like star wars and star trek, along with more baffling entries; for a moment in the mid-’90s, you could play games adapting the x-files or austin powers. nearly all of them went dormant long ago, leaving magic as the survivor. its generic setting turned out to be an advantage—you can’t lose the license or run out of storylines for fantasy worlds you’ve just made up. not that anyone at wizards entirely knew what they were doing: richard garfield developed arabian nights, magic’s first expansion set, without playtesting a single match. right before going to print, somebody noticed they’d forgotten to add flavour text, and the head editor wrote it all in a sleepless trance: “expect my visit when the darkness comes. the night i think is best for hiding all.” at least scheherazade had an audience.other early expansions were assigned seemingly at random: wizards art director jesper myfors handled the dark, designing outwards from its aesthetic of sinister preachers and backwoods rituals. legends got made by some garfield friends in vancouver, who created cards inspired by their dungeons & dragons characters. sales doubled with every set anyway, and wizards began to worry about hoarding. they printed 1994’s latest expansion fallen empires in the ever-growing numbers retailers demanded—350 million cards, more than twice as many as every previous set combined. you can still find sealed product lying around undisturbed at gaming stores today, like canopic jars in some egyptian tomb. the pitifully low power level didn’t help, and for a time it seemed that magic might be another collectible fad: pogs with dragons.few players understood the game yet either; the earliest tournaments often devolved into giant monsters smashing against each other. eventually people figured out that, although a craw wurm cost six mana to cast, you could kill or counter it for a fraction of those resources. a group of bay area players started testing increasingly defensive decks, focused on drawing extra cards, forcing them out of the opponent’s hand, and dealing with multiple threats at once. before long they just called it “the deck.” that definite article was not immodest; they had hit on crucial aspects of magic, which pulled competitive play between the stations of a trinity. control decks attack like a python, using card advantage to slowly exhaust all resistance. aggro decks try to force through lethal damage with maximum efficiency. combo decks win the game in a single ridiculous move, e.g. taking infinite turns, creating an unstoppable 20/20 creature, or generating huge amounts of mana. these extremes often blur together—the delver of secrets archetype resembles aggro-control, backing up a cheap threat with lots of ways to kill/disrupt things—which only makes them easier to obsess over.by 1996 the scene had matured enough that wizards of the coast decided to sponsor a circuit of professional events, which still influences tournaments down to the local shop. magic pros earn a living closer to lacrosse players than nba stars, although rotating the main format’s deckbuilding pool every year or two does sell plenty of booster packs. all of that was alien to me. i only remember staring at the cards themselves, and it doesn’t feel like mere nostalgia to say they’ve never looked better. richard garfield had always discouraged the busty-valkyrie style of fantasy art, but sue ann harkey, magic’s art director back then, came from outside the gaming world entirely; for the expansions mirage and visions, inspired by various african cultures, she recruited gallery painters and comics artists. there are many magic cards showing some kind of enormous demon, but mirage’s spirit of the night unnerves me most—it seems to melt forward from abstraction, a trick of the landscape.harkey hired illustrators who became some of the game’s most celebrated: rebecca guay, whose watercolors bring to mind stained glass; kev walker, a graduate from the chunky-grotesques school of british cartooning; terese nielsen, with her sense of serene grace. she also found artists who got swiftly dispatched after harkey left, my favourite being the voluptuously sexual figures of robert bliss. in his paintings, it is always big boy season. “rob, being the naughty chap that he is, would put penises in everything,” harkey later told the magic blogger jesse mason. “and ever since [a particularly well-disguised one on the card polymorph], everyone looked for penises… and then i couldn’t commission him any more.” there’s magic art i love from recent years—guay’s bitterblossom must be one of the most beautiful things ever printed on a piece of cardboard—but the reigning style is bland competence, like illustrations marketing some lavishly expensive video game, almost flaunting their conservatism.*in 2012, richard garfield published a book called characteristics of games, describing his medium with the structural analysis that roland barthes brought to narrative. to play is to wander an “impossible idea,” he wrote: “a game must keep hope alive for a reversal of fortune, even while reassuring players that everything they do has a place in a fixed progression.” characteristics of games can be surprisingly funny, albeit with a mathematician’s sense of humour—during one aside garfield notes that “taste is not commonly a factor in games, except perhaps in sports if things go drastically wrong”—and it sometimes sounds existential about that tension between human caprice and grand designs. “aesthetic appeal and support of gameplay can work against each other,” garfield argues. “aesthetic considerations often push for a greater ornateness, and gameplay wants simplicity of interface … thus in some sense artists and game designers are natural enemies.”garfield created magic: the gathering, but he left wizards of the coast two decades ago after hasbro bought the company. the game’s dominant figure over all those years has been mark rosewater, a former screenwriter, not a professor; he likes to joke about his old roseanne credits. rosewater prefers the language of genre tropes to mathematic systems. he has written that his goal is to entertain players while meeting their expectations, not unlike a hollywood producer running some cinematic universe. rosewater’s official title is head designer, but he also serves as magic’s media face, marketing pitchman, and court historian. imagine if chess were owned by a single company, and the same person creating new boards chronicled the game’s past while telling everyone how great chess was. and because that company promised not to reproduce many older, powerful chess pieces out of deference to collectors, certain formats only really get played online, the one place where enough people can afford it. magic is both performance and commodity, a pas de deux maneuvering around display cases.perhaps rosewater had that contradiction in mind when he called the widest upheaval of his tenure “new world order,” although his ambitions fell short of a planet ruled by liberal capitalism. the idea was to simplify more common cards, especially for booster draft (where you take picks one by one, like a sports draft, and then build your miniature deck). much as i love looking at complicated magic boards, those don’t always reveal good design—players might have to study a dozen overlapping effects, few of them immediately meaningful. several of the most popular draft formats were developed following new world order guidelines, including the consensus favourite, 2011’s horror-inspired innistrad. so many cards from that set feel deceptively complex, serving different roles depending on your plan; one deck used a bunch of thirteenth picks to dump its entire library into the graveyard zone, food for an army of spiders. to evoke transformations at dusk, rosewater created double-sided cards, which can shift from human to monster. no other theme has shaped his designs so neatly.dominaria, the latest magic set, returned to the game’s home plane for the first time since 2006, with garfield making guest contributions. it’s the most open-ended expansion in years, even after they restrained his stranger ideas—like the sagas, a new card type meant to represent living mythology. yet the designs still feel safer than future sight, our previous visit to dominaria. that set used nostalgia as an excuse to combine dozens of mechanics, some long gone and others only envisioned, with startling effect. one card does nothing outside of the graveyard. another can counter your opponent’s spell for free, or rather in advance; if you don’t pay its mana cost on your next turn, you lose the game. future sight approached history like a revisionist, fracturing accepted notions of how magic should play. dominaria presents a timeline of ancient relics and legendary heroes, expecting their due reverence.the new world order era coincided with magic’s audience growing exponentially, an imperial phase now tailing off. around the middle of the last century, french sociologist roger caillois critiqued johan huizinga’s idealized definition of play in homo ludens: “it is true that the kinds of games are almost infinitely varied, but the constant relationship between chance and profit is very striking … in certain of its manifestations, play is designed to be lucrative or ruinous.” caillois never imagined how deep that relationship might run, arguing that, although a casino mogul extracts money from each gambler (“the entrepreneur alone does not play”), play itself creates no wealth or material goods. he could not foresee the esports industry, which generates hundreds of millions of dollars from people watching other people play video games. magic puts up similar numbers in paper form, but it lags behind its younger digital cousins online. hearthstone usually ranks among the top five games of any genre by streaming viewership; magic scrapes to #30 on a good month.in the characteristics of games, richard garfield mentions an early example of play turning self-conscious, from edo-period japan: “the annual go games played before the shogun were eventually played out entirely in advance, the players sequestered to prevent knowledge of the results from leaking out, and then the games replayed for the shogun, all to prevent them from lasting too long for the spectators.” how simple can you make a game with 15,000 unique cards? magic online remains ugly to watch partly because it needs to handle every possible interaction—and many famous decks hinge on exploiting those intricacies. people like to say they’re playing “as garfield intended,” the joke being that the designer always wanted his creation to mutate out of control. garfield once wrote that his own favourite magic card is shahrazad, from the arabian nights expansion, which starts a new game within the game. it’s also one of the very few spells to get banned in every competitive format, since clever mages can cast it over and over until time loses all meaning.coveting the esports market, wizards has developed a flashier program called magic: the gathering arena, limited to recent sets; given the design mistakes defying rosewaterist orthodoxy, with more cards banned over the past year than the previous decade, that pitch may not be so enticing. i haunt magic online in spite of its looks. when i first returned to the game, i’d spent a month homeless, crashing on couches. my days were featureless blanks contorted by anxiety. every inscrutable aspect of magic fascinated me: i loved how improvised booster draft feels, as alliances form and dissolve. it balances chess’s chilly purity with the social theatre of poker. when i mentioned this piece to my friend michael deforge, a cartoonist and part-time mage, he wrote back: “i like that magic is always a puzzle. the deck building is a puzzle, your draft choices are a puzzle, and each game is a puzzle. even deciding what hands to keep.”at the height of world war ii, the mathematician john von neumann framed economics as a conflict between rational individuals, establishing the field of game theory. that would prove less convincing than his models for the first nuclear bomb. von neumann once argued that chess is not a game at all, because one player can always theoretically force a tie (mutual assured destruction). the precise series of moves involved remains a mystery, too vast for our computers to calculate, not that that offers weaker players any hope. in the characteristics of games, garfield estimates the odds that a chess amateur will prevail against a grandmaster—they’re also the chances of winning the new york lottery seven times straight. but magic’s rules allow for randomness, the harlequin behind every card. novices sometimes bring down hall-of-famers. nineteenth-century gamblers would seek guidance from dream books, which fastened surreal images to each play, like a soothsayer. they shared as we do an ancient fantasy, to sense the fates losing grasp of your thread.', 'atty. alex moss: >>>according to the court, the

it would review its decision of all nine etfs.the regulator has not released a deadline for its review, but it means that these applicants may still be able to forge ahead with their etfs.fears of fraudulent behavior, price manipulationthe sec provided the same grounds for rejection for each of the various etfs. the main concern seems to be that the companies are not meeting the requirements to “prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices.”furthermore, the regulatory body raised concerns about the size of the bitcoin etf market. considering that it is a very small domain, there is unease that the exchanges won’t be able to ensure that there is no market manipulation.“among other things, the exchange has offered no record evidence to demonstrate that bitcoin futures markets are ‘markets of significant size.’ that failure is critical because <...> the exchange has failed to establish that other means to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices will be sufficient, and therefore surveillance-sharing with a regulated market of significant size related to bitcoin is necessary.”it’s also important to note that the sec made it clear that its original decision was in no way influenced by — or a reflection on — the value and use cases of bitcoin and blockchain technology.\"[the agency] emphasizes that its disapproval does not rest on an evaluation of whether bitcoin, or blockchain technology more generally, has utility or value as an innovation or an investment.\"not all doom and gloomcointelegraph reached out to anthony pompliano, founder and partner at morgan creek digital assets, who addressed the topic in his off the chain newsletter this week.pompliano highlighted the main takeaways from the sec’s judgement, which seems to have been fair, while also maintaining their focus on ensuring the safety of investors.the etfs in question differ somewhat from other offerings that have also been denied by the sec. these nine etfs are ‘derivative-backed,’ meaning the exchanges own futures contracts and not actual bitcoin.while the sec will now review its latest rejection, pompliano believes that the crypto industry will only see the launch of bitcoin etfs in 2019:“the crypto industry will eventually get retail products approved by the sec. the proper infrastructure and controls need to be in place first. this work will include implementing qualified custodianship, while preventing market manipulation. it is unlikely that regulators will be satisfied with any anti-market manipulation measures created during the remainder of this year. this would push the first etf approval until 2019.”as pompliano suggests, there seems to be an infatuation with bitcoin etfs and the possibility of their issuance bringing better market sentiment for the cryptocurrency. however, these financial instruments could also have a negative effect on the stability of bitcoin’s value, as pompliano noted:“in fact, an argument could be made that an etf would simply give more people the opportunity to short bitcoin, which would drive the price lower. although this would be highly unlikely, we did see a significant increase in downward price pressures in the market with the introduction of bitcoin futures roughly nine months ago. we’re living in an unpredictable market, so anything is possible.”cointelegraph also reached out to cornell university associate professor emin gün sirer, who had positive remarks in the wake of the sec’s decision:“the reasoning by the sec is absolutely fair. the good news is that they are not saying anything negative about crypto as an asset class. in fact, they seem predisposed to accept it in the same category as every other asset, and they are applying the exact same standards as everything else. the problems they cite are not with the asset, but with the ecosystem that has been built around it.”gün sirer believes that the main stumbling block lies at cryptocurrency exchanges, which are still plagued by problems like fraud and a lack of regulatory frameworks:“the crypto community keeps hoping for a miracle, where the sec suddenly has a lapse in judgment and reverses decades of its own practice, and keeps getting disappointed as a result. the sec is patiently citing a small number of issues, all related to malfeasance or misbehavior at the exchanges. the crypto community has to learn to demand better, and evolve the ecosystem toward a higher standard.”until that happens, the cornell university professor believes the sec will continue to deny the approval of other etfs.crypto analyst brian kelly reacted to the news positively in a segment on the cnbc fast money show, suggesting that the latest move points to an eventual approval of bitcoin etfs in february 2019. the barriers to entry, in his view, is the sec’s ability to keep a close eye on trading and to identify fraud and manipulation.furthermore, kelly says that the sec believes that the bitcoin futures markets are not yet mature — having only been around since december 2017:“i think we’re incrementally closer to getting an etf and a very positive thing was that bitcoin didn’t sell-off. when a market, whether its bitcoin or oil, doesn’t sell-off on the news that it should, that means there’s a sentiment change.”waves of changewhile it’s unclear when the sec will release a finding on the review of its decision on the latest etfs, there is a lot to look forward to in september.the sec will deliver a ruling on direxion’s proposed etf on sept. 21, while the deadline for another bitcoin etf proposed by financial services company solidx and investment firm vaneck has been pushed back to sept. 30.it seems that the sec is trying to give itself more time to make well-educated decisions when it comes to new exchange-traded products. this follows their announcement in july which denied the winklevoss twins’ second application to launch a bitcoin etf.the ruling had a big effect on the cryptocurrency markets, as values dropped across the board following the decision.sec commissioner hester peirce has been a staunch proponent of the approval of bitcoin-backed etfs. when the regulatory body denied the winklevoss twins’ bitcoin etf for a second time, she publically dissented from the ruling.in her statement, peirce said the very creation of bitcoin-related, exchange-traded products (etp) would allow mainstream and institutional investors to gain exposure to the cryptocurrency in a regulated and more sheltered environment:“an etp based on bitcoin would offer investors indirect exposure to bitcoin through a product that trades on a regulated securities market and in a manner that eliminates some of the frictions and worries of buying and holding bitcoin directly. if we were to approve the etp at issue here, investors could choose whether to buy it or avoid it.”sec trying to get it rightwhile it seems like the sec has taken a hard stance against exchanges applying to launch bitcoin etfs, it is worth taking a step back and looking at their overarching rhetoric on the topic.this latest decision to review the findings of its own staff suggests that the regulatory body is performing a bit of a juggling act.as sec ceo jay clayton said in february, the organization would like to create an environment that encourages growth in the space while protecting investors from fraudulent practices and scams:“simply said, we should embrace the pursuit of technological advancement, as well as new and innovative techniques for capital raising, but not at the expense of the principles undermining our well-founded and proven approach to protecting investors and markets.”thus the very issues that the sec is trying to address could well be answered through the use of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology.conventional exchanges are kept in check by auditors and legal entities, which ensure that markets are protected from irregular or fraudulent behavior of exchanges. this is where gün sirer thinks blockchain tech and cryptocurrencies could revolutionize the space:“crypto assets are special and different. its possible for us to implement technical measures that can prohibit such malfeasance by construction. that is, crypto has the opportunity to not only meet, but exceed the standard to which the sec holds wall street. we can lead the world here and lead every other asset class through judicious and careful use of technology, and facilitate the tokenization of conventional assets in the process. of course, this requires a switch away from blind speculation in rigged markets, toward better technological developments. the sooner the crypto community gets behind a unified push to clean up exchanges and implement better, high-assurance decentralized exchanges, the sooner sec-approved etfs will become a reality.”market volatilitythe sec’s announcement that it would review its initial finding had a notable effect on the cryptocurrency markets, with bitcoin rebounding after an slight pull-back following the original rejection on august 22.it marks a week of volatility, which was also influenced by china’s latest crackdown on cryptocurrency-related events in certain parts of beijing. bitcoin was trading at around $6,790 at the time of publishing.bitcoin 7-day price chart. source: cointelegraph bitcoin price index', 'advertisementbitcoin advocate andreas antonopoulos offered his opinion on bitcoin etfs in a rather foreboding video released on august 14.he first explained the concept of an etf or exchange-traded fund as a fund that has a custodian or manager that creates a special financial instrument that is similar to a stock. in the case of bitcoin etfs the instrument is a fund that holds bitcoin and sells shares in a bitcoin reserve that represents the price of bitcoin as a stock that can be traded through regular brokerage accounts on the stock market.the custodian holds the actual bitcoin and the customer buys a share in the funds without having to navigate the often rigorous and complex process of registering for cryptocurrency exchanges, completing kyc, and familiarizing themselves with encrypted keys and wallets.the cryptocurrency space has lauded the inevitable arrival of etfs as a crucial event that will greatly increase the market cap of cryptocurrency and essentially save cryptocurrency investors and traders from the current bear market, taking cryptocurrency to the next level as a financial market. in his video antonopoulos outlined in no uncertain terms what he sees as the dangers of bitcoin etfs, citing the market manipulation that took over the price action of gold as an example.“i’m going to burst your bubble. i know a lot of people want to see bitcoin etfs because ‘lambos’ and ‘to the moon’ and all that. i think it’s a terrible idea. i still think it’s going to happen, but i think it’s a terrible idea. i’m actually against bitcoin etfs.”apart from the potential of increased market manipulation by major market makers as is seen in the commodities markets, antonopoulos is concerned over the issue of consensus.bitcoin holders essentially have the right to vote on certain issues based on which exchanges they choose to trust their coins with, which fork they support, etc.“if there is ever a fork debate, which is very likely to happen again in any cryptocurrency, then the fund that controls that bitcoin now has a very large voice. their shareholders don’t. they don’t get to choose which fork the fund is going to follow in a bitcoin debate… we already saw that level of influence during the august 1st fork, user activated software forks, bitcoin cash, the scaling debate… large custodial exchanges had a very strong voice in the ecosystem. they were able to decide if they were going to support or not on behalf of 10 million customers… an etf will do that and it will do that on an even bigger scale”centralized fund managers having millions of votes in the bitcoin ecosystem allowing for manipulation in price action, scaling debates, and forks is the main concern for the antonopoulous who foresees disagreements over forks between major etfs leading to splits forming currencies akin to “corporate bitcoin.”in a situation where authorities are pressuring the community to make bitcoin less private and more transparent, it could be the case that an etf would feel obliged to comply with the regulatory pressure and refuse to adopt privacy measures, creating a separate, corporate bitcoin market.the prominent bitcoin advocate’s views were mirrored by former wall street executive caitlin long in a ccn interview in which she denounced the involvement of wall street financialization in the crypto space due to the bad practices it would inevitably bring.featured image from wikimedia.advertisement', 'when talking about e-commerce, investors often focus on amazon.com (nasdaq:amzn), the 800-pound gorilla of the market, and the industries its disrupting with its ever-expanding ecosystem.however, they shouldnt ignore three other high-growth companies that are changing how companies do business over the internet: shopify (nyse:shop), square (nyse:sq), and grubhub (nyse:grub). all three stocks have generated multibagger returns over the past three years, and they could soar even higher on some long-term tailwinds.1. shopifyshopify assists companies in designing, setting up, and running online stores. it helps them process orders, payments, and shipments; launch marketing campaigns; build online customer relationships; and measure their overall performance with cloud-based analytics. simply put, its a one-stop shop for building a companys e-commerce presence.new features like payments platform shopify pay, a point-of-sale (pos) card reader, a wholesale channel for buyers, bulk label printing options, and apis (application programming interfaces) for integrating its platform into third-party apps have expanded its ecosystem. shopify also offers merchants cash advances through its financial arm, shopify capital.revenue rose 62% year over year last quarter, as subscription solutions and merchant solutions revenue soared 55% and 68%, respectively. shopify expects its full-year sales to grow 51% to 53%, compared to 73% growth in 2017. the company isnt profitable on a gaap basis, but its been profitable on a non-gaap basis for the past four quarters.2. squaresquare disrupted the market for traditional pos systems with the square reader card-reading dongle for smartphones, the square stand pos solution for ipads, and the stand-alone square register. it then tethered its merchants to an expanding ecosystem of cloud-based services for managing payroll, inventory, customer relationships, deliveries, shopping data, and website designs. it even loans money to merchants through its financial unit, square capital.the company also owns the food delivery app caviar, which it recently integrated into its unified square for restaurants bundle of services for booking tables and managing payments. for consumers, it offers square cash, one of the most popular mobile p2p (peer-to-peer) payment apps in the u.s. square cash is also the only major p2p payments player that lets its users buy and sell bitcoin.squares revenue surged 48% annually last quarter. on an adjusted basis, which excludes transaction-based costs, bitcoin costs, and deferred revenue adjustments, revenue climbed 60%. squares total transaction-based revenue and gross payment volumes both grew 30%. square still isnt profitable on a gaap basis, but its non-gaap earnings surged 86% last quarter. looking ahead, it expects its adjusted revenue to jump 54%-57% for the year and for its adjusted earnings to go up 56%-70%.3. grubhubgrubhub owns the top online food delivery platform in america. its portfolio of services -- which include its namesake app, seamless, eat24, menupages, allmenus, diningin, and other apps -- controls about half of the u.s. food delivery market, according to second measures march estimates. its closest rivals, uber eats and doordash, controlled 21% and 15% of the market, respectively.not only does grubhub continually scale up by acquiring smaller rivals, but its also building an ecosystem atop its high-growth niche. the company recently acquired levelup, a payments and loyalty services provider, which could help it counter square for restaurants and cross-sell more services to its growing list of restaurant partners.revenue surged 51% last quarter, thanks to grubhubs acquisition of eat24, 35% growth in daily average grubs (orders), 39% growth in gross food sales, and a 70% jump in active diners.unlike shopify and square, grubhub is consistently profitable by both gaap and non-gaap measures. last quarter, its non-gaap net income rose 99% year over year, gaap earnings more than doubled, and adjusted ebitda grew 61%. wall street expects grubhubs revenue and non-gaap earnings to grow 44% and 59%, respectively, this year.high risks and high rewardsshopify, square, and grubhub generate a lot of growth, but all three stocks have lofty valuations. shopify trades at over 230 times forward (2019) earnings, square at almost 100 times forward earnings, and grubhub trades for nearly 60 times forward earnings. those valuations are based on non-gaap figures -- they would be even higher if gaap figures were used.therefore, these stocks definitely shouldnt be core holdings for most investors. however, investors looking for riskier investment opportunities with potentially high returns should take a closer look at these high-growth digital retail plays.', 'bitcoin price bitcoin at $60k matter of ‘when,’ not ‘if’ — says bobby leeas china beefs up its cryptocurrency ban and us regulators reject more bitcoin etfs, famous faces are reaffirming their beliefs that bitcoin prices could still hit up to $60,000 by 2020.‘more stability, liquidity and faster adoption’in the face of several regulatory setbacks for bitcoin this week, btcc co-founder bobby lee and fundstrat global advisors’ tom lee both went on record in recent days to forecast a turnaround in the fortunes of the largest cryptocurrency.“when (bitcoin) passes the usd $60,000 price level in the coming years, it‘ll reach a total circulation

that the us securities and exchange commission (sec) had rejected a total of nine etf applications this week. pressure from beijing similarly failed to spark panic, marking a divergence in market behavior compared to similar announcements made in 2017 and the early half of 2018.lee stands by $20k 2018 predictionon the topic of the “virtuous cycle,” the btcc ceo also mentioned on social media — consisting of adoption and hence improved price performance — a number of macro factors needed to line up for bitcoin to have its shot. specifically, emerging markets should rally for btc/usd to do the same, as bitcoin’s 2017 all-time highs and subsequent cool-off coincided with similar behavior on the msci emerging markets index versus the s&p 500.the links between the two, he told cnbc, were hedge funds and wealth effect.“hedge funds typically rent emerging market stocks, so they’re risk-on, risk-off… when they’re risk-off, bitcoin also suffers because they’re risk-off,” he explained.…if you’re living in an emerging market and you see your stock market fall hugely, that means you’ve got a lot less money to buy bitcoin, so that affects the network effect.going forward, lee stuck with his end-of-year forecast for btc/usd, agreeing it would hit $20,000 in 2018.what do you think about bobby lee and tom lee’s latest predictions? let us know in the comments below!images courtesy of

gpu render (1225) 26:48 5:02where to buythe wx 9100 is a high-end professional workstation card that supports ecc memory is intended for large computing jobs or a high volume of them in a zero-fault environment.to support this goal, the wx 9100 comes with 16gb of hbm2 memory, 4096 stream processors and is based on amds latest 12nm vega architecture. for outputs, the card has six mini-displayport 1.4 connections supporting 10-bit output.all of these features add to a graphics card costing $1500 which will definitely seem high for the consumer market, now that the bitcoin squeeze on pricing is over. but, to those needing that kind of computational heft, its not a bad buy even when you add the egpu enclosure.well be comparing the wx 9100 and sonnet combo to the best graphics card available in our 2018 15-inch i9 macbook pro , the 4gb radeon pro 560x. well also be connecting that machine to the amd 580 pro blackmagic egpu which houses a radeon pro 580 graphics chip with 8gb of memory.we used the set-egpu script to force all applications to use the egpu, but this shouldnt be required with macos mojave.starting off with geekbench 4s opencl test, the wx 9100 scored more than double that of our macbooks internal graphics and a bit higher than blackmagics unit.doing a quick benchmark run in unigines heaven benchmark which tests gaming graphics performance, the wx 9100 once again performs more than twice as good as the 560x and about 45% faster than the blackmagic egpu.moving on to video editing tasks, we first ran the bruce x benchmark for final cut pro which mostly taxes the graphics cards.running the final cut x stabilization filter on a 20-second 4k video clip, the wx 9100 egpu performed the task in just 7 seconds, compared to 13 with both the integrated 560x and blackmagics egpu.in davinci resolve, this task went from 28 seconds to 17 seconds with black magics egpu and then to 14 seconds.we do video editing tasks daily, obviously —a task that many are looking to improve with an egpu. starting with rendering a 5 minute 4k project using standard h.264 footage with color correction and effects, we didnt see any improvement in final cut x, with the blackmagic egpu actually slowing it down.we suspect that the highest-end graphics available in the 2018 15-inch macbook pro is already fast enough at rendering this footage with effects to the point that cpu isnt limited. on top of that, there is some bandwidth constraints made worse by having to send the data through thunderbolt 3 not only to the gpu to be rendered, but also back to our software.as we move on to much tougher codecs like canon cinema raw lite where internal graphics are a huge bottleneck, we see some major improvement even with a short one-minute timeline. not only did our render go from almost four times longer than the project itself to less than half that time, but our timeline performance went from and unusable 20 frames per second, to 55 frames per second which is a massive improvement.in davinci resolve, we went from 20 minutes with the internal 560x, to 15 minutes with the blackmagic egpu, and just 8 minutes with the wx 9100.taking a look at a 1 minute 4.5k red raw project with color correction and effects, we dont see much change in final cut pro because our cpu is the bottleneck. davinci resolve uses the graphics cards more so we see about 60 percent faster speeds with the wx 9100.applying noise reduction is often needed with raw footage, and it usually makes anything but the highest end computers like a higher spec imac pro choke. with temporal noise reduction added in resolve, our wx 9100 finished the job in nearly one-third of the time than the 560x and the timeline had very few dropped frames making it workable where the macbook wasnt.to finish off this first round of testing, we used blender to test the 3d rendering capabilities of the radeon pro wx 9100 vs the internal radeon pro 560x. we used the 1225 bmw test project available on blenders website and used the graphics cards to render. here, the wx 9100 completed the task at just 5 minutes vs close to 27 minutes on the macbook pro alone.in conclusion, the wx 9100 is a very powerful card that can greatly speed some professional tasks. on top of that, tasks that require dual precision gpus and ecc memory are now possible, without purchasing a dedicated workstation computer capable of this.we at appleinsider are very excited about the possibilities that egpus offer and are looking forward to even better support in macos mojave.amds radeon pro wx 9100 graphics card is currently available from third-party sellers on amazon for $1,449.99 . b&h also has the video card in stock for $1,499.99 with free expedited shipping and no tax collected outside new york and

2016, braving its infamous battery of job interviews to land a spot as business development & strategic partnerships at jigsaw — the not-so-well-known team of security specialists at alphabet, with a big, ambitious mission: ensuring that technology is used for good.fighting terroristsgeorgiou is an international law and business expert who speaks five languages, including arabic and armenian, and has lived all over the world.reuters/zohra bensemra she first became aware of jigsaw after it was born in 2010 as google ideas, under founder jared cohen.cohen is a counter-terrorism expert who worked under both condoleezza rice and hillary clinton. he came to google as the tech giant began to realize that the internet was a double-edged sword, just as capable of helping spread information as it was of enabling bad people to do bad things.the group was originally trying to counter the rising wave of terrorists using social media and the web to radicalize people.jigsaws work has since expanded to counter other misuse of the web, such as booting internet trolls from web forums. it is also working to protect news or political websites from distributed denial of service (ddos) attacks — a common technique where bad guys make a website inaccessible by overloading it with fake web traffic.the redirect methodthat first week on the job, when she flew to iraq for her interviews, was \"fascinating,\" georgiou describes, but it was \"also really useful\" to talk to people who were recruited in that way.\"thanks to these insights, weve developed something called the redirect method,\" she says, now used by organizations across the globe.rather than just removing that recruitment content, jigsaws method advises education. anyone searching for that content is shown videos and ads that debunk the propaganda, instead.this method is really important, she says, because of how many young people were getting drawn in by promises of honor and glory if they left their existing life behind and joined the fight.\"you think of an isis terrorist as this old guy. but they were all like 20-21, they were kids,\" she says referring to the people she interviewed.\"they really thought they were going to muslim disneyland.\"they were promised a \"perfect religious world,\" but \"instead they wind up in this place of war and terror and dictatorship where they take away your phone and burn your passport and you cant even leave if you want to and you are tortured or you have to kill people,\" she says.that research taught the jigsaw team that the most powerful way to combat radicalism wasnt to remove content, but to help would-be terrorists get a sense of the reality of what theyre signing up for.trolls and conspiraciesfor google, a lot of the problems that jigsaw is tackling hit close to home. its youtube service, for instance, has come under broad criticism for how its algorithm can surface misinformation and conspiracy theories, in its endless and automated quest to show you more of what it thinks youll be interested in. it also means that someone who watches one conspiracy theory video will be served up way more of them, deepening the viewer inside an insular echo chamber.those seeking moon landing conspiracy theory videos on youtube are shown factual videos. youtube but youtube has taken advantage of jigsaws redirect method to fight these effects.it has begun to surround so-called misinformation and conspiracy videos with links and context in the hopes to inform the viewer, it said in july.some have argued that these tactics arent enough and that youtube needs to do more to outright ban these people from its platform — much like it eventually banned conspiracy theorist alex jones earlier this month after days of controversy.but georgiou is encouraged by youtubes work to defend against misuse, she says, and by the investment alphabet is making in jigsaw. its crew has grown from six people when she joined, to about 60 today.\"obviously, its not an easy problem to solve because on youtube alone there are 300 hours of videos that are uploaded every minute, and hundreds of millions of comments uploaded to facebook and twitter every minute,\" she said. \"even if you hired the entire humanity to review every single thing on the internet there would not be enough.\"but, she says, she believes the internet companies really are taking their role seriously. \"there are a lot of different initiatives being done in this area,\" she says.for instance, theres an industry effort called the global internet forum to counter terrorism, which includes youtube, facebook, microsoft, twitter and others. and there are other efforts, like share the facts, which helps fact-checkers work and share their results across the internet and is used by google news.', 'advertisementin the past 24 hours, the bitcoin price has increased from $6,400 to $6,700, recording a decent increase in its daily volume.the valuation of the crypto market has increased from $210 billion to $215 billion within a two-day period, fueled by the short-term surge in the price of tokens.ethereum-based tokens like wanchain, aion, and icon recorded solid gains in the range of 10 to 20 percent against both the us dollar and bitcoin, showing some momentum against major cryptocurrencies.ethereum, ripple, bitcoin cash, and eos, the top five cryptocurrencies in the global market, have struggled to demonstrate a recovery in their volume and price, closing the day with mere 0.3 to 1 percent gains, falling behind bitcoin and the rest of the market.bitcoin dominance still strongin previous reports, ccn noted that the dominance index of btc, which measures the dominance of the cryptocurrency over the global market, is an important metric to measure the short-term growth and momentum of tokens and small market cap cryptocurrencies.in the past seven days, the dominance index of btc has increased from 51 percent to 53.6 percent, despite the recovery in the price of btc.under normal circumstances, tokens tend to demonstrate 10 to 20 percent gains if btc rises by 3 to 5 percent in value, as investors become more confident in investing in high-risk and high-return trades. however, this week, tokens have not been able to record large movements on the upside.bitcoin’s strong dominance over the market suggests that investors are thoroughly convinced that the corrective rally from $6,200 to $6,700 has established a platform for the rest of the market to continue a short-term rally over the upcoming weeks.while many analysts have suggested that the momentum of bitcoin will likely enable the dominant cryptocurrency to surpass the $7,000 mark, it may take bitcoin to break out of the $7,000 resistance level for tokens to see a rapid increase in value in the short-term.throughout the past few months, btchas declined by more than 30 percent, from the $9,000 region to mid-$6,000. tokens have fallen 60 to 70 percent against bitcoin, recording 95 percent losses against the us dollar.over the past 12 hours, 10 percent of bitcoin short contracts on bitfinex, the biggest margin trading platform in the cryptocurrency market, have been closed, suggesting that bears are not confident in betting against the newly found momentum of bitcoin.as such, it is more likely for bitcoin to test the $7,000 mark in the next few days, rather than dropping back to the lower end of the $6,000 region.bear market is not over, but good to accumulateerik voorhees, the ceo of shapeshift, one of the most popular peer-to-peer digital asset exchanges in the market, has said that the bear market is not over for crypto but it is a good time to accumulate given the low price range of most cryptocurrencies.most investors still expect the price of bitcoin to endure one last minor correction before initiating a mid-term rally but the general sentiment around the crypto market remains positive.featured image from shutterstock. charts

short-term trend of bitcoin.in may, bitmex ceo arthur hayes stated that he would like to see the btc price fall to the $5,000 region before recovering and initiating a 2017-esqe rally to ensure that the market does not expose itself to the creation of a minor bubble.this week, shapeshift ceo erik voorhees and cryptocurrency investor anthony pompliano, better known as pomp, echoed the sentiment of hayes, stating that the bear market of bitcoin is not over just yet.$5,000 before $10,000on cnbc crypto trader, hosted by ran neuner, voorhees, the founder and ceo of major digital asset trading platform shapeshift, said:“i don’t expect it (bear market) to end soon, although i do think that the rate of collapse has slowed considerably. generally in these bubbles, after you go through several months of a downtrend you hang out in a range for a while… but i think we are done with a majority of the collapse.”voorhees offered a relatively enthusiastic viewpoint on the trend of the crypto market, noting that while the bear market of bitcoin has evidently not ended, the worst part of the correction has slowed down.last week, researchers at diar reported that the rate of bitcoin’s volatility has dropped to a 14-month low, as btc demonstrated stability in the mid-$6,000 range since august 6, for around three weeks.as seen in previous 80 percent corrections and rallies in 2012, 2014, and 2017, bitcoin has traditionally required a period of stability before initiating a large rally on the upside.hence, the btc price demonstrating stability in the range of $6,300 to $6,700 over the past three weeks is positive, but the dominant cryptocurrency will need to show months of stability before establishing a strong foundation to support its next big rally.however, pomp has not been as optimistic as voorhees and hayes, as he wrote in his latest newsletter that he sees the price of btc falling to the $3,000 region before recovering to the $10,000 resistance level.“the final data outputs left me with a few uncomfortable conclusions. the most notable one is that we are likely to see bitcoin near $3,000 before we see bitcoin at $10,000 again. if this is true, that means we still have ~50 percent price decrease to go. things may get really, really ugly if this happens,” pomp noted.what happens to bitcoin in december?some analysts see bitcoin falling to $5,000, $4,000, and even $3,000 before recovering. but, most of the analysts share the sentiment that bitcoin will rebound to major resistance levels in the $10,000 to $15,000 range by the end of december.predictions of most experts and analysts in the cryptocurrency space change on a regular basis, as it is difficult to speculate the exact region btc will fall to and recover from. it is important for investors to look at the mid-term trend of bitcoin, analyzing actual metrics like volume and market demand to foresee the future trend of bitcoin.featured image from shutterstockadvertisement', 'bitcoin bitcoin

naval expansion hits high gear: china’s navy acquires 15 warships in 7 months“, which was originally released by southfront on july 19, 2018:while there was much fanfare and attention given to the july 3rd launch of two type 055 guided missile destroyers at the dalian shipbuilding industry co. (disc) shipyard in dalian, very little mention has been made of the many other warships that the plan has launched or commissioned since the beginning of the year. although the type 055 ddg is the plan’s most powerful surface combatant, and the largest such vessel constructed by an asian nation since world war ii, they are one component in a steadily growing naval force structure. while the addition of three type 055 ddgs this year, added to the first vessel in class which rolled into the water from dalian just over a year ago in june of 2017, showcase china’s growing capabilities not only in producing powerful and modern warships, they also illustrate the maturity and stunning capacity of the chinese ship building industry. this industry has launched and/or commissioned 15 modern warships in just the first seven months of 2018.three more type 055 destroyersthis year is proving to be a big year for the plan. of the fifteen vessels built so far in 2018, three have been the newest and most powerful surface warfare vessel in the chinese arsenal, the type 055 ddg. the world was stunned when china was able to complete the first of this new class in june of 2017. sections of a second in this class were clearly visible in satellite imagery at the time. that vessel was launched in may of this year, but two more type 055 destroyers were launched simultaneously on july 3rd, just two months later. the 5th and 6th vessels in class are already in varying stages of construction.although initial reports had suggested that a total of six vessels had been ordered, it has been hinted that this number has been increased to eight. this number will most likely grow to at least 12 vessels by 2025, when the plan will be looking to expand its aircraft carrier program with the introduction of at least one carrier of the type 002 class. it has yet to be determined if this new carrier (cv-18) will employ steam or electromagnetic catapults, but it will definitely be a catobar carrier. plan aviators continue to practice catobar take-off and landings at the huangdicun airbase in southern china. chinese naval engineers have had a great deal of success in developing an electromagnetic aircraft launching system (emals) that requires much less energy than the system currently utilized aboard the u.s. navy’s gerald ford class carrier. it remains to be decided if the type 002 will be conventionally powered, or will make use of a nuclear reactor.regardless of the next generation carrier’s specific design specifications and capabilities, powerful surface warfare ships will be required to escort them in a larger aircraft carrier battle group formation. the type 055 ddg will likely serve a similar role as the ticonderoga class cg of the u.s. navy within the carrier strike groups (csg), and will also be utilized as a command ship or heavy aaw and asw platform in plan naval task forces or while supporting amphibious ready groups (arg). the type 055’s significant weapons payload, multifaceted offensive and defensive capabilities, and great range and endurance will aid chinese efforts to protect and expand its maritime territories, protect its shipping lanes, and maintain its naval lines of communication.type 052d ddg continued growtha number of photos that appeared both online and in the print media exhibiting the two newest type 055 ddgs to be launched at the disc shipyard in dalian failed to mention that three brand new type 052d destroyers also appeared in these same images. the type 052d is a powerful guided missile destroyer in its own right, rivaling the u.s. navy arleigh burke class ddg. china launched the first type 052d, the kunming ddg-172 in 2014. there are currently 9 ships of the class in service, 2 undergoing sea trials, and a further two being fitted out. three type 052d ddgs have been commissioned in the first half of this year.although original rumors had hinted at 16 vessels being ordered, some inside sources now claim that the number has been increased significantly. it would seem reasonable that a total of 18 to 26 vessels may end up being built, dependent upon how ambitious the plan aircraft carrier program becomes. ihs janes defense weekly reported on may 2nd of this year that satellite imagery appeared to show a type 052d under construction at the jiangnan changxingdao shipyard in shanghai that had approximately 4 meters (13.1ft) added to its loa. the after flight deck may have been lengthened to accommodate larger helicopters which would aid the vessel in its asw role.it remains to be seen if the above mentioned modification will enter serial production under a different designation, or will prove to be a concept testbed for fielding larger rotary wing assets at sea. it is important to note that china produced six type052c class ddgs from 2004 to 2015, and has produced thirteen of the much improved type 052d class ddgs in just four years, a six fold increase in annual production.more frigates and corvetteswhile smaller warships do not enjoy the limelight of their larger peers, they can teach the observer a great deal about a nation’s maritime defense posture and priorities. while the chinese shipbuilding industry has constructed and launched nineteen type 052 ddgs of both variants, and four type 055 ddgs from 2014 to the present, they have also turned out fourteen type 054a class guided missile frigates (total of 32 of all variants) and a no less than twenty type 056a class corvettes (total of 42 in class of all variants) over the same period of time.the smaller warships traditionally perform a number of different roles in naval warfare. firstly, they serve as coastal patrol craft. they are nimble and fast, heavily armed for their diminutive size, and are outfitted to be flexible enough to perform a multitude of different missions. their small size equates to limited firepower and shorter range, but they are well suited to serve as picket ships and screening forces to task forces fielding larger and more powerful vessels when those fleets are operating within close range of home ports and naval facilities.the type 056a class corvette is ideally suited to patrol china’s coasts, the maritime territories within china’s eez, as well as the island archipelagos of the paracel and spratly islands. they will most likely begin patrol operations from the key island bases at fiery cross reef, subi reef, and mischief reef as the maritime logistics facilities on these islands are improved.the type 054a frigate is a well balance and powerful naval surface combatant for its size, and carries an ample arsenal of anti-aircraft, anti-ship, and anti-submarine weapons. it is an ideal escort vessel with a range of over 8,000 nautical miles. it is a traditional multi-purpose frigate, possessing the inherent ability to attack other surface ships, engage aircraft, and track and destroy submarines. it is this class of warship that the plan first sent to the gulf of aden in 2009 to serve in international anti-piracy duties. eleven type 05a frigates have served on anti-piracy duties in this region since that time.the type 054a class frigate is a flexible, yet powerful surface warfare asset that possesses significant range and the ability to engage in a multitude of operations. it is equipped with an aft hangar and flight deck, and carries either a ka-28 or harbin z-9 helicopter depending on mission requirements. type 054a ffgs will likely be deployed as part of naval flotillas stationed on a rotational basis at the plan naval base in djibouti, and eventually at gwadar, pakistan. they will also be used to police the long maritime supply lines to and from china to strategic waterways near the horn of africa and the straits of hormuz, as well as continuing patrols in the south china and east china seas.new nuclear submarineswithout a doubt one of the segments of chinese defense strategy most shrouded in mystery are the attack submarines and ballistic missile submarines of the plan. they are very rarely a topic of discussion by government officials, either on or off the record. what is known is that the plan has a newer ssn and ssbn in service. china’s submarine technology has run behind that of both the united states and russia for decades, but china has been rapidly closing the gap in recent years. it is no secret that chinese espionage efforts to acquire u.s. submarine warfare technology have been very active, and quite successful over the past decade in particular.the most capable nuclear attack submarine (ssn) in service with the plan is the type 093b. a notable improvement over the type 093, it has the capability to fire submarine launched cruise missiles (slcm) while submerged via a dorsal mounted vls. like its predecessor, the type 093, it retains the ability to fire slcms from its bow torpedo tubes. this is accomplished by using a specifically designed torpedo tube missile canister. it is not known how many type 093b ssns are currently in service, but most analysts, including those at the u.s. office of naval intelligence, put the number at six. of greater interest is the newer ssn that is either currently being fitted out or is undergoing sea trials later this year, the type 095.the type 095 is an ssn, but reportedly has a sizeable vls (12-16 cells) which can fire a multitude of plan missiles including anti-ship cruise missiles (ascm) and land attack cruise missiles (lacm). the u.s. office of naval intelligence has classified the type 095 as a nuclear attack guided missile submarine (ssgn) due to its large missile capacity. the type 095 is thought to utilize pump-jet propulsion, make use of noise reducing technologies, and a hybrid pressure hull design.the type 095 is being constructed at the new bohai shipbuilding heavy industry company (bshic) submarine manufacturing facility located in huludao, in the liaoning province. it is the largest submarine manufacturing facility in the world, with an assembly building measuring some 430,000 square feet (39,948 sq. meters). completed in 2017, the main assembly hall can accommodate four submarines at any given time. the facility is totally enclosed, and operations cannot be viewed from the air or via satellite surveillance. this also allows manufacturing operations to continue year round regardless of weather conditions. the facility will be used to build all type 095 ssn and type 096 ssbn class submarines.the type 094 jin class nuclear ballistic missile submarine has also undergone a noticeable transformation, resulting in what has been renamed the type 094a. improvements to the new variant include a larger vls aft of the conning tower, a more streamlined shape which produces less noise and cavitation while submerged, likely greater speed submerged (less hydrodynamic drag), and a new ballistic missile armament. the type 094a is most likely equipped with the next generation jl-2a submarine launched ballistic missile (slbm). the jl-2a is based on the df-31, and has an estimated maximum range of 11,200 kilometers (6,960 miles). the jl-2a is likely equipped with a multiple independently targetable reentry vehicle (mirv) warhead. the plan likely has between four and six type 094/094a class ssbns in service. these ssbns serve as the third leg of the nuclear deterrent triad that china lacked for so many years, and the 094a offers china a viable second strike capability. the type 096 ssbn currently being designed will offer notable improvements over the 094a ssbn, yet little is known about the project.the sixth and final type 071 lpd?the final type 071 class lpd of the original order of six vessels was launched at the hudong-zhonghua shipyard on january 20th of this year. the fifth vessel was launched just 7 months prior. it remains unknown if the plan will decide to order additional lpds of this class, or will concentrate instead on the larger type 075 lhds currently under construction at the same shipyard which constructed all six type 071 lpds.it is logical to conclude that china may decide to build additional type 071 lpds, but this will depend perhaps on how long it takes to construct, launch and commission the first of the new class of lhds. with six lpds in service, after the final two vessels are finally commissioned, the plan will always have at least two of them ready to deploy as the backbone of a small amphibious ready group (arg). a plan arg would likely consist of at least one type 071 lpd, 2 type 072 lsts and a surface warfare escort of a mix of ddgs and ffgs.these smaller amphibious warfare vessels lack the size and capability of bringing their own aviation strike element with them. the type 071 can accommodate two helicopters on its large aft flight deck, and is equipped to house four helicopters in the adjacent hangar. the type 072 lst can also accommodate one helicopter on its after flight deck. lacking a vstol attack aircraft, the plan will most likely modify the z-10 attack helicopter for naval use, with it serving a similar purpose as the u.s. marine corps ah-1z viper and russian ka-52k naval attack helicopters. china has already conducted take-off and landing tests with z-10s on both the type 071 lpd and 072a lst. the type 075 lhd will undoubtedly have an attack element of at least eight to ten modified z-10s.it is clear that a larger amphibious warfare platform is a requirement for the plan in the immediate future. if the time it took china to design, build, launch and fit-out its first indigenous aircraft carrier is an indicator, we are likely looking at the first type 075 to be launched sometime in 2020. fitting out and sea trails will take an additional two years before the first vessel is commissioned. the lhd is without a doubt the most flexible and capable of all amphibious warfare platforms and the plan will need these vessels to be able to field viable args to respond to challenges within its maritime territories and to project power at greater ranges along the full length and breadth of the maritime silk road.the all important support vesselschina signaled to the world that it fully intended to field aircraft carrier battle groups (cbg) in the near future when it launched the first type 901 fast combat support ship in december of 2015. built by guangzhou shipyard international company ltd. (gsi), the first vessel in this class hulun hu (hull # 965), commissioned in september of 2017 after successful sea trials and unrep trails, bears the distinction of being the only fast combat support ship fielded by a nation other than the united states, which operates the sacramento and supply class vessels. these massive underway replenishment ships are designed to be able to meet the logistics needs of fast moving carrier battle/strike groups.the type 901 is a massive vessel, with a fully loaded displacement of 48,000 tons. it is equipped with five liquid bulk cargo transfer stations, three on the port side and two on the starboard side, and is also equipped for liquid transfers astern. they can refuel an aircraft carrier with fuel oil and aviation fuel to starboard while supplying fuel oil to surface warfare escorts to port. the disclosed cruising speed is in excess of 25 knots, which is likely understated. it is equipped with a large aircraft hangar and flight deck that can accommodate large z-8 heavy transport helicopters which are well suited to aerial replenishment duties. a second type 901 is currently in an advanced state of construction.the plan also operates the type 903 and type 903a class fleet replenishment vessels. the type 903 was greatly improved and took on the designation type 903a with the first two examples commissioned in the summer of 2013. there are six type 903a replenishment ships on active service, and a seventh currently in an advanced state of construction. these vessels have a fully loaded displacement of approximately 24,000 tons and can carry 10,500 tons of bunkers (fuel), 250 tons of potable water, and roughly 700 tons of dry cargo.fleet replenishment vessels are a vital component of a blue water navy. they allow fleet task forces, carrier battle groups and amphibious ready groups to engage in complex missions thousands of miles from home ports and over extended periods of duration. they replenish fuel, food stores, fresh water and munitions to warships while underway, and can provide a rapid logistics solution to both naval and land forces deployed to far flung bases and garrisons. these vessels are indispensable to aircraft carrier battle groups engaged in long deployments.the big picture, plan 2025the rapid pace of warship construction by china is impressive from an engineering and manufacturing standpoint, but of greater interest is in understanding the motivation behind such an ambitious program. why has the chinese leadership decided that the plan must expand and acquire a full spectrum of naval warfare capabilities that it has previously lacked, and in such a short space of time? the answer to this question becomes clear after a short analysis of china’s geopolitical, economic and national security goals in the twenty-first century.in many ways, china is engaged in a concerted effort to redefine the economic realities that have established the way the world exchanges goods and services, and distributes the product of human endeavors globally. the new silk road/maritime silk road project seeks to once again make china the center of the economic world. china is already the largest economy in the world in terms of economic production, and is on pace to usurp the u.s. as the world’s largest economic consumer as well. continued growth and prosperity depend upon cheap and efficient movement of energy resources and raw materials to china, and the cheap and efficient movement of finished goods from china. the overwhelming majority of these influxes and outflows transit the international waterways of the world. continued prosperity and stability depend upon the security of these maritime lanes of trade. in strategic terms, these naval lines of communication must remain open. in times of strife and natural or man-made disaster, china must have the capacity to secure these lines of communication and to keep them open. the great naval strategist rear admiral alfred thayer mahan, writing in 1893, then just a captain, stated this concept very succinctly:“let us start from the fundamental truth, warranted by history, that the control of the seas, and especially along the great lines drawn by national interest or national commerce, is the chief among the merely material elements in the power and prosperity of nations. it is so because the sea is the world’s great medium of circulation. from this necessarily follows the principal that, as subsidiary to such control, it is imperative to take possession, when it can be done righteously, of such maritime positions as contribute to secure command.”although china has been the first and most determined nation to move in this direction, it is not alone. as china moves to build a new logistics system that aims to redirect the movement of information, energy, and economic goods that competes with the current established system dominated by the united states, the united states and its allies are determined to maintain the status quo. some of these allies, such as india, are allies of necessity and are also attempting to maintain their independence. china has accepted the wisdom of long standing naval strategy, and has proven the most decisive in embracing these centuries old concepts.if china does not alter its current building projects by increasing or reducing orders, the plan will still be a highly transformed fighting force by 2025. the year 2025 will prove to be a milestone for the plan for many reasons. by 2025, china will likely be declaring its first type 002 class aircraft carrier operational. the type 002 will be an emals assisted catobar capable carrier that may likely be nuclear powered. at the same time, two other aircraft carriers, although recognized as developmental steps along the way to the type 002, will also be in service. based on the pace of pilot training and the procurement of aircraft over the past decade, the plan will have at least one more regiment of carrier strike aircraft in service, bringing the total to two regiments. china is already seeking to develop and field a carrier borne strike aircraft superior to the j-15, even though many of the j-15’s shortcoming will be rectified by the improved catobar system of the new type 002 carrier.the plan will have 30 type 054a frigates, 18 type 052d and 8 or more type 055 destroyers in service. improvements upon the destroyers will likely occur in the intervening years. a total of 50 type 056 corvettes (28 of the type 056a improved variant) will be policing the coastal waterways of china and its outlying island territories. these modern and capable surface warfare vessels will be supplemented by older vessels that china has been actively modernizing.the plan will be able to transport an enlarged pla marine corps to battle in its first amphibious ready group, albeit with limited capabilities. the first type 075 lhd will be undergoing operational training to test the capabilities of the vessel and familiarize sailors, marines and airmen with amphibious and air assault missions from such a complex and powerful platform. there will be six type 071 lpds in service, as well as 15 type 072a lsts. the majority of an additional 17 type 072 lsts of an earlier, yet sound design will still be in service. the recently expanded plamc, numbering approximately 100,000 men, a five-fold increase from 2017, will finally have the modern amphibious sealift capacity that it currently lacks. plamc marines will serve in duties deployed at sea and stationed at a growing number of chinese sovereign island bases, or abroad at naval bases in foreign countries such as pakistan and djibouti.by 2025, the plan will have a robust naval logistics arm available to support naval operations across the length and breadth of the maritime silk road. two type 901 fast combat supports ships, and 9 type 903a replenishment ships will be available at a minimum. four type 904 general stores issue vessels are currently in service to resupply island garrisons and offshore bases. this number may be increased in the intervening years.of equal interest is the question of just how the u.s. navy will look in 2015. it will still be the largest and most powerful navy in terms of global reach and power projection; however, it is a military branch that seems to be without focus or direction. the plan has increasingly invested in high tech, powerful and flexible conventional warships that are also cost effective when compared to the new designs pursued by the u.s. navy. even the type 002 aircraft carrier is a conservative design, with a limited mission foreseen for it, one which will minimize its weaknesses and make use of its strengths. it is telling that china has built the largest surface warfare ship since the u.s. commissioned the last ticonderoga class cruiser port royal cg-73 in 1994. the u.s. has no plans to replace the 22 ticonderoga class cruisers anytime soon, nor is there a replacement design to consider. the gerald r. ford class cvn-78 has proven to be a costly and disappointing investment so far. it will use the f-35 jsf and f-18 super hornet which lack the range to be a threat to peer adversaries. the zumwalt class ddg is a dead end failure and the troubled lcs program has proven to be less capable than the traditional multi-purpose frigate designs of other major navies.while the u.s. has wasted its great wealth on failed designs, whose sole aim is to earn profits for a defense industry more interested in profit-generating waste than in producing weapons systems that balance capability, efficiency and cost effectiveness, china has done something quite different. china has produced cutting edge warships and aircraft for its navy that are largely improvements upon proven designs and technology. china has made major progress in missile technology, surpassing the u.s. in many respects. it has also reaped rewards from years of investment in research and development of advanced radar and even photon detection technologies. there is no doubt that china has gotten far more return on its investments in terms of its defense industry in comparison to the united states. for the military defense complex that rules the united states the goal is profit, not the defense and security of the nation.from 2001 to the present, the united states military has morphed into a force obsessed with counterinsurgency and occupation, leaving it woefully unprepared for a conventional conflict with peer adversaries, such as russia or china. the u.s. navy has transformed into a global police force meant to be used as a stick to bludgeon any small nation that dares to disobey the diktats of washington. its powerful aircraft carrier strike groups (csg) lack the air wing capable of striking the shores of powerful adversaries, rendering these great symbols of u.s. power impotent against any capable foe in a major conflict. the u.s. navy is powerless to change the strategic situation in the south china sea through military means, as china has already “crossed the rubicon”. imperial hubris, corruption and arrogance have done greater damage to the u.s. military than any foreign adversary has over the past 17 years.the year 2025 will witness a plan in ascent and a u.s. navy in decline. this is not to say that the u.s. navy will not still be the preeminent naval power globally, but it will continue to be mired in a lack of strategic direction, focus and budgetary crisis. the plan will be guided by a clear strategic focus, increasing capabilities, and a robust shipbuilding and weapons acquisition program. there is no doubt that the plan will emerge as the second most powerful navy in the world, and will exert significant influence in both military and geostrategic terms.donate', 'saturday, august 25: crypto markets are showing bullish sign of a persuasive recovery. virtually all of the top

proposal had also been rejected by the sec, which then saw a comparable $12 billion wiped from total market capitalization.the tumble has nonetheless proved to temporary in the immediate-short term. as crypto analyst brian kelly argued on cnbc this week, the fact that the “market didn’t sell off” on news of the most recent etf denials is a bullish sign of “sentiment change” that suggests many nonetheless expect we are coming “incrementally closer” to eventual etf approval.this has been reinforced by news that the sec plans to review its fresh spate of etf rejections, as well as voices within the agency — notably sec commissioner hester m. peirce — who have officially dissented from the regulator’s prior btc-related etf rejections.', 'bitcoin price bitcoin at $60k matter of ‘when,’

went on record in recent days to forecast a turnaround in the fortunes of the largest cryptocurrency.“when (bitcoin) passes the usd $60,000 price level in the coming years, it‘ll reach a total

news that the us securities and exchange commission (sec) had rejected a total of nine etf applications this week. pressure from beijing similarly failed to spark panic, marking a divergence in market behavior compared to similar announcements made in 2017 and the early half of 2018.lee stands by $20k 2018 predictionon the topic of the “virtuous cycle,” the btcc ceo also mentioned on social media — consisting of adoption and hence improved price performance — a number of macro factors needed to line up for bitcoin to have its shot. specifically, emerging markets should rally for btc/usd to do the same, as bitcoin’s 2017 all-time highs and subsequent cool-off coincided with similar behavior on the msci emerging markets index versus the s&p 500.the links between the two, he told cnbc, were hedge funds and wealth effect.“hedge funds typically rent emerging market stocks, so they’re risk-on, risk-off… when they’re risk-off, bitcoin also suffers because they’re risk-off,” he explained.…if you’re living in an emerging market and you see your stock market fall hugely, that means you’ve got a lot less money to buy bitcoin, so that affects the network effect.going forward, lee stuck with his end-of-year forecast for btc/usd, agreeing it would hit $20,000 in 2018.what do you think about bobby lee and tom lee’s latest predictions? let us know in the comments below!images courtesy of

qualifying for sundays races at knockhill this weekend.the team dynamics civic type r driver grabbed top slot with four minutes to go in the 30-minute session to eclipse andrew jordan (wsr bmw 125i m sport) and annex the top time by just 0.051 seconds.the session was stopped in the opening minute as bobby thompsons team hard vw cc, which had been off the road in the opening practice session and did not take part in the second, stopped with a technical problem.that dropped oil on the track, bringing the session to a halt as a stretch of the track between the pit exit and clarks corner was treated, and meant the faster times came at the end of the session.cammish, who was stripped of pole position at brands hatch at the start of the season for a weighbridge infringement and also narrowly missed out at snetterton in july, said he was relieved to have finally banked top spot.\"once i had done the lap, i had the same feeling i had at brands hatch where i knew i couldnt have done a better lap,\" said cammish.\"having come so close before, i was wondering what i had to do to snag a pole. it means the world to me.\"cammishs pole, which smashed the previous qualifying benchmark of 51.521s from 2016, came after a battle with the bmws of jordan and stephen jelleys team parker racing-run 125i m sport. jelley snatched a front row start on his final lap.the leicester racer said: \"at other places we have maybe struggled for straight line speed, but there arent any long straights here.\"the car has been handling brilliantly and i could just romp all over the kerbs.\"i had done some simulator work before i got here and i was in a good mindset, but i am really pleased we have managed to show what we could do.\"jordan was disappointed to be relegated to third in the dying moments, having been the first man to lap the fife track in under 51s with just five minutes remaining.\"i am disappointed because we left something on the table there,\" said the 2013 champion.\"i was pleased with the 50.9s, but the session was just scruffy after that with lots of red flags which ruined things for us.\"behind the top three, championship leader colin turkington performed

increased from $210 billion to $215 billion within a two-day period, fueled by the short-term surge in the price of tokens.ethereum-based tokens like wanchain, aion, and icon recorded solid gains in the range of 10 to 20 percent against both the us dollar and bitcoin, showing some momentum against major cryptocurrencies.ethereum, ripple, bitcoin cash, and eos, the top five cryptocurrencies in the global market, have struggled to demonstrate a recovery in their volume and price, closing the day with mere 0.3 to 1 percent gains, falling behind bitcoin and the rest of the market.bitcoin dominance still strongin previous reports, ccn noted that the dominance index of btc, which measures the dominance of the cryptocurrency over the global market, is an important metric to measure the short-term growth and momentum of tokens and small market cap cryptocurrencies.in the past seven days, the dominance index of btc has increased from 51 percent to 53.6 percent, despite the recovery in the price of btc.under normal circumstances, tokens tend to demonstrate 10 to 20 percent gains if btc rises by 3 to 5 percent in value, as investors become more confident in investing in high-risk and high-return trades. however, this week, tokens have not been able to record large movements on the upside.bitcoin’s strong dominance over the market suggests that investors are thoroughly convinced that the corrective rally from $6,200 to $6,700 has established a platform for the rest of the market to continue a short-term rally over the upcoming weeks.while many analysts have suggested that the momentum of bitcoin will likely enable the dominant cryptocurrency to surpass the $7,000 mark, it may take bitcoin to break out of the $7,000 resistance level for tokens to see a rapid increase in value in the short-term.throughout the past few months, btchas declined by more than 30 percent, from the $9,000 region to mid-$6,000. tokens have fallen 60 to 70 percent against bitcoin, recording 95 percent losses against the us dollar.over the past 12 hours, 10 percent of bitcoin short contracts on bitfinex, the biggest margin trading platform in the cryptocurrency market, have been closed, suggesting that bears are not confident in betting against the newly found momentum of bitcoin.as such, it is more likely for bitcoin to test the $7,000 mark in the next few days, rather than dropping back to the lower end of the $6,000 region.bear market is not over, but good to accumulateerik voorhees, the ceo of shapeshift, one of the most popular peer-to-peer digital asset exchanges in the market, has said that the bear market is not over for crypto but it is a good time to accumulate given the low price range of most cryptocurrencies.most investors still expect the price of bitcoin to endure one last minor correction before initiating a mid-term rally but the general sentiment around the crypto market remains positive.featured image from shutterstock. charts from

currency exchangeswechat shuts down numerous crypto media accountstop crypto exchanges join winklevosses’ self-regulatory organizationthis wednesday, the united states securities and exchange commission released orders on nine bitcoin exchange traded fund (etf) proposals. each of the three orders, like those that preceded them, shot down all of the etfs in question.but these decisions, the sec revealed the next day, are now up for review. this development has offered a glimmer of hope for the industry in its slow-slog toward a bitcoin-backed, exchange-traded product.in the march toward clearer crypto regulation in the states, exchanges have taken the lead in an attempt to quicken the pace. the virtual currency association, a self-regulatory organization spearheaded by the winklevosses and their gemini exchange, added three new members this week. with these latest additions, the vca continues to work toward its goal of “establishing an industry-sponsored, self-regulatory organization (sro) to oversee virtual commodity marketplaces,” in advance of a summit to be held this september.while the u.s. grapples with regulations and oversight for its own virtual currency markets, the chinese government is looking to siphon its citizens’ access to crypto trading venues. chinese officials shuttered access to over 120 offshore exchanges this week, an extreme measure to accompany the comprehensive ban it effected on domestic icos in september 2017.meanwhile in the private sector, wechat is assisting the government with its crackdown. the number one messaging platform in china purged crypto and blockchain media accounts from its services this week, citing the government’s policies toward icos as justification for the bans.news from the bitcoin mining industrysoftbank denies reports of bitmain deal; bitmain still silentmining like a viking: how the fjords of norway offer a greener alternativeall eyes were on bitmain this week, as public and media scrutiny continues to pick apart the details of the chinese mining behemoth’s forthcoming public offering.after reports surfaced last week claiming that japanese telecom company softbank and chinese internet provider tencent had invested in bitmain via a private pre-ipo funding round, a handful of companies came forward this week to deny their involvement.in a feature article, bitcoin magazine’s colin harper took a trip to norway to survey the work of northern bitcoin, a german mining company that has taken advantage of the abundance of renewable energy norway’s fjords produce.situated in lefdal mine, a defunct mine turned data center in måløy, the 3,250 miner strong asic mining farm operates at nearly half the electricity cost of its competitors and with zero co2

research claims satoshi mined far fewer bitcoins than previously thoughtop ed: making friends with time in the cryptocurrency spaceever since bitcoin developer sergio lerner presented compelling evidence on the topic in 2013, the bitcoin community has assumed that satoshi nakamoto mined — and held on to — roughly 1,000,000 bitcoin during the network’s inaugural year. new evidence from bitmex research, on the other hand, suggests that this figure may be in the ballpark of 600,000-700,000 btc.finally, iost ceo jimmy zhong reminds us of the importance of perspective in times of market anemia. these are the times, zhong argues, that real growth can be realized, and that those who focus their efforts on development despite the downturn will be better for it when things start to look up again.“life is a long journey. we often say that choice is more important than effort. we also need to understand that desire and choices only pull through with persistence. i hope we can have faith in our common choice, the future of technology, the power of market cycles; remain unwavering in the face of swaying market sentiment; make independent and clear-headed judgments; and, together, build something people truly want,” zhong writes.', 'according to research from prominent cryptocurrency trader jacob canfield, who plotted out his findings against a btc price chart on the popular charting site tradingview, cnbc’s tweets can be used as a contrarian bitcoin price indicator with as much as 95% accuracy.cnbc: a contrarian indicator with 95% accuracycanfield claims that almost “every single bullish tweet” has been at or near the top of nearly every btc rally in 2018. meanwhile, each bearish tweet has represented a reversal of a previous downtrend.in the last week alone, candield says, cnbc has made three bearish tweets, potentially indicating that bitcoin has reached a bottom.canfield, who operates a daily crypto trading signal site, says that cnbc themselves have reached out to the trader to potentially be a guest on one of their shows.cnbc has been long been seen as a contrarian indicator after famously reporting on how to buy ripple after the cryptocurrency reached an all-time high of $3, only to then report on how to sell the #3 cryptocurrency by market cap after a massive sell off to below $1 had occurred, at the time signaling the then-bottom for xrp.considering the accuracy of canfield’s research and the consistency at which cnbc seems to make contrarian calls, let’s hope that cnbc decides that bitcoin is a bust in their upcoming documentary, which could signal the final rally that ends the 2018 bear market.bitcoin: boom or bust?as bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency by market cap and the cryptocurrency that started it all, reaches a pivotal moment in its existence, major american media brand cnbc will air a special 60-minute documentary this coming monday night, august 27.on monday, august 27, at 6pm et, cnbc will air a new documentary focused on bitcoin. the documentary, entitled “bitcoin: boom or bust” and hosted by cnbc fast money host melissa lee, will be a deep dive into the original peer-to-peer electronic cash created by the mysterious satoshi nakamoto.according to a press release, the documentary will explore the “good, bad, and the ugly” sides of bitcoin. topics include crypto evangelists, how bitcoin is used by escorts in the sex trade industry, billionaire venture capitalists, crypto revolution anarchists, and much more.“this original documentary employs pop culture, captivating imagery and a hip-hop score (a staple in crypto-culture) as it follows a wide range of fascinating characters, each with their own passionate argument either for or against bitcoin.”cnbc plans to show both sides of the “coin,” including commentary from bears and bulls alike. this includes what cnbc calls a “riveting and colorful interview” with the wolf of wall street, jordan belfort, who compares bitcoin to the scams he ran during his con man days, as well as a “chilling tour” through the dark web to let viewers see the often unseen criminal underworld associated with cryptocurrency.', 'published on aug 24,

cryptocurrency-related “bold and vicious fraud,” bloomberg reported august 24.earlier this year, patrick mcdonnell, cryptocurrency promoter and operator of cabbagetech corp., was charged with “fraud and misappropriation in connection with purchases and trading of bitcoin (btc) and litecoin (ltc).” mcdonnell subsequently argued that the cftc did not have the authority to regulate his commercial operations; however, new york district judge jack b. weinstein rejected his claim.in july, weinstein reportedly held a nonjury trial where he claimed that mcdonnell ran a “boiler room,” deceptively luring investors in different states and counties using “trickery, false statements and misappropriation of funds,” bloomberg notes. weinstein delivered a judgement that mcdonnell must pay $290,429 in restitution and $871,287 in penalties.according to bloomberg, cabbagetech was not represented by a lawyer, as mcdonnell claimed he could not afford to pay for counsel. mcdonnell also stopped appearing in court during the trial.mcdonnell was also involved in a different lawsuit by the cftc against his another company, coin drop markets. the cftc claimed in the the lawsuit that customers who paid mcdonnell and coin drop for crypto trading advice did not receive the advice they paid for, and that mcdonnell shut down coin drop’s website and failed to respond to customers. the lawsuit also notes that coin drop was not registered with the cftc.last month, speaking from capitol hill, congressman bill huizenga argued that congress should empower financial regulators such as the u.s. securities and exchange commission (sec) and the cftc to regulate the cryptocurrency market in compliance with the same rules governing other currencies and stocks.in may, the cftc chairman chris giancarlo said he doesn’t see comprehensive crypto legislation coming from the federal level in the near future, pointing out that the statutes by which the cftc is operating were written in 1935. he added that embracing a modern innovation like bitcoin within terms invented decades ago will take time.', 'advertisementthe sec has disapproved 10 bitcoin exchange-traded funds (etfs) in the past month but analysts believe bakkt can assist the launch of the first bitcoin etf.bakkt’s efforts in finding trusted price formationlast month, the sec officially rejected the winklevoss bitcoin etf filed with the bats bzx exchange with a 92-paged document which explicitly stated that the commission was not satisfied with the dependence of the value of the etf on public cryptocurrency exchanges.specifically, the sec said that strictly regulated exchanges like gemini operating in the us market with a proper license are still not resistant to manipulation, and hence, there exists risk involved in basing the base value of a bitcoin etf on the price listed on exchanges.“in section iii.b, the commission addresses bzx’s assertion that bitcoin and bitcoin markets, including the gemini exchange, are uniquely resistant to manipulation and finds that the record before the commission does not support such a conclusion,” the sec said.but, the sec further emphasized that the disapproval of the winklevoss bitcoin etf does not signify the commission’s stance on cryptocurrency or blockchain but simply the lack of a trusted price formation that may leave the etf and the global bitcoin market open to price manipulation.the sec added:“although the commission is disapproving this proposed rule change, the commission emphasizes that its disapproval does not rest on an evaluation of whether bitcoin, or blockchain technology more generally, has utility or value as an innovation or an investment.”conclusively, the denial of the winklevoss etf mainly pertained to its reliance on gemini to establish the value of btc, which the sec did not approve of.bakkt already solved 2 issues laid out by secrecently, bakkt, a new company designed to bring digital assets to the mainstream created by microsoft, starbucks, and new york stock exchange (nyse), stated that it is working on building a consistent regulatory construct; transparent, efficient price discovery; and an institutional quality pre- and post-trade infrastructure.more importantly, bakkt, which is targeting to serve institutional investors in the us market, said that its exchange will not allow btc to be traded on margin or leverage, which is the primary reason why the nine etfs from proshares and direxion were rejected this week.[editor’s note: the sec has since said that the commission will review those rulings, which had been made by agency employees.]“a critical element to price discovery is physical delivery. specifically, with our solution, the buying and selling of bitcoin is fully collateralized or pre-funded. as such, our new daily bitcoin contract will not be traded on margin, use leverage, or serve to create a paper claim on a real asset,” the bakkt team said.in the past month, the sec laid out the following to issues as the main problems of the 10 etfs that were rejected:lack of trusted price formationreliance on futures markets and derivativesthe bakkt exchange satisfies both requirements from the sec and if bakkt continues to establish its focus on finding a trusted price formation, it is possible that it could impact the approval of the first bitcoin

happens.', 'advertisementanother attempt is being made at brokering a compromise before the bitcoin cash civil war culminates in a permanent blockchain split, and it’s coming from what may initially seem like an unlikely source: cobra, the pseudonymous co-owner of bitcointalk and bitcoin.org.earlier this year, cobra — originally a critic of bitcoin cash — came out in support of bch, though he continues to also support btc while taking some controversial positions such as arguing for a change to the network’s proof-of-work (pow) consensus algorithm.now, he’s launching what he calls a “safe and reliable” full node bitcoin cash implementation in an attempt to prevent a civil war between bch development teams bitcoin abc and nchain from causing a network split that permanently damages the cryptocurrency’s reputation.dubbed “cobra client,” the software adopts neither canonical transaction ordering nor any of opcode activations proposed by bitcoin abc and nchain, which cobra argues do not have enough consensus support to justify immediate activation.what it does include, however, is replay protection, ensuring that users who run this instance of the bch software will not be at risk of replay attacks — which occur when an attacker broadcasts the same transaction on multiple blockchain forks — if the network splits into two or more chains following the scheduled network hard fork in november, which increasingly seems like an inevitability.according to cobra, such a blockchain split would be a “disaster” for bitcoin cash and even a temporary fork would “cause lasting damage.”he wrote:“such a consensus failure will be a disaster for all investors and users of bitcoin cash, but it is almost impossible to avoid at this point as all the developers and miners involved refuse to back down. such a scenario will wipe out huge amounts of value from bitcoin cash, lead to total ridicule of the currency, and widespread loss of trust and faith. such reputation damage is simply not worth it, all just so some developers and miners can avoid having their egos bruised around some mostly unimportant and non-urgent changes. even a temporary fork will cause lasting damage.”cobra claims that, prior to announcing his client, he worked behind-the-scenes to secure support from a broad coalition of bch stakeholders. this group, he says, includes at least a quarter of the bitcoin cash hashrate (nchain’s proposal also has explicit support from about one-fourth of the hashrate), as well as “a number of major businesses” including one “major cryptocurrency exchange” who has agreed to list the cobra fork’s coins under the “bch” ticker symbol. however, he has not yet disclosed the identities of these supporters, nor have they come forward.this isn’t the first attempt to broker a compromise ahead of the fork. bitcoin unlimited, whose software client is used by approximately one-third of bch node operators, has said that it will make all of the changes proposed by abc and nchain available in its software and has encouraged users to switch to bu to signal their support for a compromise that will afford miners more control over which individual upgrades activate on the network.featured image from shutterstockadvertisement', 'once again, bitcoin finds itself precariously perched on the bottom of its macro trading range (tr). after a strong round of selling over the course of two weeks plunged the price back to the $6,000s, bitcoin began consolidating for several weeks at the bottom of the tr:figure 1: btc-usd, 1-day candles, macro tras shown in the figure above, the market has interacted several times at the current price range and it has been a source of three major bullish rallies. currently, there is a lot of bearish pressure trying to submerge the price but very little price movement. if we take a look at the open long and open short positions on bitfinex, we actually see a record-setting short count for the year as shorts outnumber the longs by almost 30%:figure 2: btc-usd, 1-day candles, longs vs. shortsso far, this is the highest the short count has been since bitcoin topped late last year. also, one thing to note is not only how high the short count is, but how high it is compared to the open long positions.in situations like this, where the shorts far outnumber the longs, the perfect scenario for what’s known as a “short squeeze” is created. if the shorts continue to stack within a given price range, as we are seeing now, then there is a high possibility for a cascade of short liquidations/short covering to take place.basically, what happens is this: as shorts begin to liquidate, they are forced to buy back their position and propel the price higher. this movement, in turn, begins to liquidate the other positions with stops set just above them which then cascade the liquidations (and the price) higher and higher.if we look at the bollinger bands (bbands) on the daily candles, we can see the price is consolidating very tightly as the bbands have begun to “squeeze” around the price action thus indicating price consolidation.figure 3: btc-usd, 1-day candles, bollinger band consolidationtypically, when bbands squeeze, this is a forecast for increased volatility. and, because these are daily candles, it is likely that the next move will be a macro move in either direction.it’s impossible to know with certainty which way the price will move, but given the number of shorts that keep opening — and the relatively low amount of price movement — the stage is set for a pretty sizeable move upward.there’s no concrete rule that says “high short count always yields a short squeeze,” but the foundation is definitely laid for one. the last time we had shorts anywhere this level, the price jumped 20% in one day. the short count back then was just under 38k bitcoins. the short count right now is 38.6k bitcoins.summary:bitcoin is, once again, testing the support of the macro tr.as shorts begin to rise, the price is seeing very little reaction. as a result of the high short count over a relatively narrow price range, there is a possibility of a sizeable short squeeze.to further support just how narrow this price range has been and just how tightly wound the market is right now, the daily bbands show a strong squeeze on a macro level that will likely yield a strong move in either direction.trading and investing in digital assets like bitcoin and ether is highly speculative and comes with many risks. this analysis is for informational purposes and should not be considered

their money back, or at least some of it, anyway.according to a notice dated aug. 23 and attributed to mt. gox trustee nobuaki kobayashi, the company has opened an online claim filing system so that creditors can begin registering claims on the funds that they lost when the exchange, once the dominant bitcoin trading platform, became insolvent in 2014. creditors can also fill out claim forms offline and submit them through the mail.as ccn reported, mt. gox went bankrupt after losing an estimated 850,000 btc — most to hackers, but some to embezzlement — although former ceo mark karpeles later found about 200,000 btc. the theft long remained the largest cryptocurrency exchange hack in history, and though it has since been surpassed by the coincheck hack in jan. 2018, it remains the most significant theft in terms of its impact on the industry as a whole.had the exchange remained in bankruptcy, creditors would have been compensated in cash at a rate far below bitcoin’s current market price. meanwhile, karpeles — who has been charged in japan for embezzling funds from the exchange and spent nearly a year in prison while awaiting trial — would have likely received the excess funds accrued from the sale of the company’s remaining cryptocurrency assets, a payout that would have been worth hundreds of millions of dollars.however, a japanese court ruled in june that mt. gox could exit bankruptcy and commence civil rehabilitation proceedings. moving the company into civil rehabilitation does not guarantee that creditors will be refunded in cryptocurrencies rather than cash, but the structure of this type of civil proceeding is much more flexible, which leaves the door open to a direct bitcoin distribution, depending on what stipulations appear in the court-approved rehabilitation plan.according to the mtgox cold wallet monitor, the company’s estate is holding 137,891 btc, worth more than $910 million at the time of writing, as well as an equivalent amount of bitcoin cash, worth $73 million.importantly, all creditors must submit claims on their assets, including those who previously submitted claims as part of the company’s bankruptcy proceedings. the deadline for filing is oct. 22. the trustee will then submit a list of approved and rejected claims to the court by jan. 24, 2019.featured image from shutterstockadvertisement', 'staff at the sec on wednesday rejected applications for new funds from three companies. photo: iolinternational - the us securities and exchange commission said on thursday it will review a decision by its staff to block nine bitcoin-based exchange-traded funds from coming to market.staff at the sec on wednesday rejected applications for new funds from three companies, suggesting they were not yet convinced that the products would not be subject to fraud or manipulation.but the sec’s four commissioners will review those decisions, according to letters the sec posted on its website.sec staff have delegated authority to make a decision on such applications, meaning the commissioners and the sec chairman have the power to review the decision if they desire.the commissioners had previously voted 3-1 to reject another bitcoin etf application, with republican commissioner hester peirce dissenting on the basis she felt doing so stifled innovation.the virtual currency can be used to move money around the world quickly and with relative anonymity, without the need for a central authority, such as a bank or government. a fund holding the currency could attract more investors and push its price

crisis in a series of articles and presentations starting in 2006. however, roubini is no one trick pony – his research on emerging markets makes him an expert on speculative bubbles of all sorts.it’s no surprise, therefore, that he’s now sticking pins in the entire cryptocurrency/blockchain bubble of bubbles.at last week’s blockshow conference in las vegas, roubini did not mince his words. “there has been a total collapse this year in the cryptocurrency game,” he told an audience largely skeptical of his point of view. “it’s a crypto apocalypse.”deflating bitcoin and all other cryptos as wellnouriel wasted no time poking holes in every bitcoin sacred cow. for example, the claim that bitcoin can serve as money. “bitcoin is not money. to be money it would need to be a unit of account, means of payment, and a stable source of value and purchasing power,” nouriel explained. “bitcoin is none of these. other cryptos are worse.”he contrasted bitcoin and other blockchain-based payment technologies with modern payment systems like paypal , square , and alipay in china. “today’s digital systems are used by millions of people per day, and have nothing to do with blockchain,” he said.bitcoin’s second sacred cow to fall to roubini’s withering arguments: decentralization. “decentralization is a total myth,” roubini explained, as crypto miners (transaction processors), exchanges, developers, and wealth are all in fact centralized.while in theory, anybody can be a crypto miner, successful mining requires immense investment that leads to pooling of mining resources. as a result, “the top five mining pools control 70% of all mining,” roubini pointed out – mostly in places like russia, china, belarus, and other places where organized crime syndicates dominate the crypto world.centralization of wealthcrypto aficionados tout its ability to distribute wealth beyond financial insiders to anyone with a smartphone. the reality, however, is quite different. not only is 99% of crypto trading taking place on a small number of centralized exchanges, but the people with the wealth from such trading are few in number as well.to illustrate the extent that crypto centralizes wealth, roubini referred to the gini coefficient, an economic term that expresses distribution of wealth across a population from 0% (everybody equally wealthy) to 100% (one person has all the wealth.)the gini coefficient for europe, for example, is about 50%. north korea stands at 86%. and bitcoin? how about 88%. “bitcoin wealth is more concentrated than north korean wealth,” roubini pointed out.taking the wind out of tokensas i concluded in my last article, much of the activity around blockchain is nothing more than pathetic sleight-of-hand games with worthless tokens.i’m sure roubini would agree. “a world with thousands of tokens makes zero economic sense,” he said. “tokens are only good for gouging consumers.”if tokens don’t make sense, then it would follow that initial coin offerings (icos) wouldn’t make much sense either. “icos are effectively non-compliant securities,” he said, pointing out that while many ico fans position their ‘coins’ as utility tokens rather than security tokens to avoid securities laws, the reality is that they are in fact securities – and in the us at least, illegal ones.what about smart contracts?ethereum is the second most popular crypto behind bitcoin, likely because it’s possible to run ‘smart contracts’ on the ethereum blockchain. what does roubini think of smart contracts? “they’re neither smart nor contracts,” he said.they are too plagued with hard-to-fix bugs to be smart, and until the lawyers give the thumbs up, the word ‘contract’ is overly optimistic as well.furthermore, even though ethereum has become established in crypto circles, smart contracts – and the distributed apps or ‘dapps’ that leverage them – haven’t amounted to much. “75% of dapps are crypto kitties, ponzi schemes, and casino games,” roubini pointed out.where does that leave blockchain? “a peer-to-peer distributed public ledger is total nonsense,” roubini added – leaving only private, permissioned blockchain solutions with trusted individuals or organizations processing the transactions.when the scammers have milked the crypto insanity for all its worth and they and their marks have all gone home, permissioned blockchain solutions – what i refer to as ‘enterprise blockchain’ – will be all that remains.intellyx publishes the agile digital transformation roadmap poster, advises companies on their digital transformation

to the one that came in response to july’s news that the winklevoss twins’ high-profile btc etf proposal had also been rejected by the sec, which then saw a comparable $12 billion wiped from total market capitalization.the tumble has nonetheless proved to temporary in the immediate-short term. as crypto analyst brian kelly argued on cnbc this week, the fact that the “market didn’t sell off” on news of the most recent etf denials is a bullish sign of “sentiment change” that suggests many nonetheless expect we are coming “incrementally closer” to eventual etf approval.this has been reinforced by news that the sec plans to review its fresh spate of etf rejections, as well as voices within the agency — notably sec commissioner hester m. peirce — who have officially dissented from the regulator’s prior btc-related etf rejections.', 'advertisementin the past 24 hours, the bitcoin price has increased from $6,400 to $6,700, recording a decent increase in its daily volume.the valuation of the crypto market has increased from $210 billion to $215 billion within a two-day period, fueled by the short-term surge in the price of tokens.ethereum-based tokens like wanchain, aion, and icon recorded solid gains in the range of 10 to 20 percent against both the us dollar and bitcoin, showing some momentum against major cryptocurrencies.ethereum, ripple, bitcoin cash, and eos, the top five cryptocurrencies in the global market, have struggled to demonstrate a recovery in their volume and price, closing the day with mere 0.3 to 1 percent gains, falling behind bitcoin and the rest of the market.bitcoin dominance still strongin previous reports, ccn noted that the dominance index of btc, which measures the dominance of the cryptocurrency over the global market, is an important metric to measure the short-term growth and momentum of tokens and small market cap cryptocurrencies.in the past seven days, the dominance index of btc has increased from 51 percent to 53.6 percent, despite the recovery in the price of btc.under normal circumstances, tokens tend to demonstrate 10 to 20 percent gains if btc rises by 3 to 5 percent in value, as investors become more confident in investing in high-risk and high-return trades. however, this week, tokens have not been able to record large movements on the upside.bitcoin’s strong dominance over the market suggests that investors are thoroughly convinced that the corrective rally from $6,200 to $6,700 has established a platform for the rest of the market to continue a short-term rally over the upcoming weeks.while many analysts have suggested that the momentum of bitcoin will likely enable the dominant cryptocurrency to surpass the $7,000 mark, it may take bitcoin to break out of the $7,000 resistance level for tokens to see a rapid increase in value in the short-term.throughout the past few months, btchas declined by more than 30 percent, from the $9,000 region to mid-$6,000. tokens have fallen 60 to 70 percent against bitcoin, recording 95 percent losses against the us dollar.over the past 12 hours, 10 percent of bitcoin short contracts on bitfinex, the biggest margin trading platform in the cryptocurrency market, have been closed, suggesting that bears are not confident in betting against the newly found momentum of bitcoin.as such, it is more likely for bitcoin to test the $7,000 mark in the next few days, rather than dropping back to the lower end of the $6,000 region.bear market is not over, but good to accumulateerik voorhees, the ceo of shapeshift, one of the most popular peer-to-peer digital asset exchanges in the market, has said that the bear market is not over for crypto but it is a good time to accumulate given the low price range of most cryptocurrencies.most investors still expect the price of bitcoin to endure one last minor correction before initiating a mid-term rally but the general sentiment around the crypto market remains positive.featured image from shutterstock. charts

quantities of cryptocurrencies units to their wallet address. in return, these hackers promise high yields at a later date. these tricks have worked so well in the past that it has moved legitimate personalities to issue a clarification to their followers. vitalik buterin even changed his twitter profile’s name, stating that he does not give free ether.the only defense a twitter user can apply

hottest companies in silicon valley, flush with vc cash. dozens of global brand names have announced pilot programs with its technology. one of its products, recently featured on ellen, is the third largest cryptocurrency in the world.yet if you ask the right questions, ripple will all but deny any connection to that famous asset, xrp.the company and its defenders have made “xrp is not ripple” a continuous mantra over the past few months, changed the digital token’s logo, and even amended testimony to the u.k. parliament in a transparent attempt to fend off regulatory scrutiny.and, in a blog post published wednesday, ripple claims that xrp “is in many ways a more transactional, functional and decentralized ledger than either bitcoin or ethereum.” a statement from ripple to breitbart news strips away any caveats: “xrp is even more decentralized than bitcoin and ether.”what is xrp?xrp is a digital “altcoin” that first entered public markets in 2013, though many market analysts call it “ripple” for its close association to the company. it saw a meteoric rise in price over 2017, going from six tenths of a penny in january to an all-time high of $3.79 one year later. at the time of this writing, it has an estimated market capitalization of $13 billion.all digital monies, starting with bitcoin, are simply ledgers — records of credits and debits from a total balance set by their coders — but they are “distributed ledgers,” meaning hundreds or thousands of people all keep a copy of the ledger to compare the integrity of the data. to ensure that no one double spends their personal balance, a network of “nodes” or “validators” stay online 24/7 to check all incoming transactions against the full history of the ledger.why wouldn’t ripple want to claim xrp?as regulators examine the world of digital money — bitcoin and its hundreds of imitators, competitors, and scams — billions of dollars are at stake. none of the major exchanges are yet legally authorized to trade securities, so if the sec declares certain assets to be unregistered securities, they will be universally de-listed and likely see their value drop near zero. and, on top of that calamity, then the coins’ creators may face legal and financial penalties.kyle samani, managing partner at the crypto hedge fund multicoin capital, told fortune in june: “it’s quite clear to us that ripple is a security… if [the sec labels it as such], liquidity is going to dry up on xrp and the price will plummet.”the two biggest, most vulnerable targets for regulators are xrp and the ethereum foundation’s ether, according to former cftc chairman gary gensler. bill hinman, director of the sec’s corporation finance division, has since said that ether in its current state is sufficiently “decentralized” and not considered a security — though that does not automatically mean that the “initial coin offering” for ether was not a securities sale.one big uncertainty hanging over the crypto markets has been whether the 2nd and 3rd largest coins — ether and xrp — should be categorized as securities. a top sec official just said they dont think ether should be, but didnt mention xrp. — nathaniel popper (@nathanielpopper) june 14, 2018but hinman, the sec official, said that if a token is guided by a third party that holds lots of token, and takes actions to increase the value of that token, it is probably a security. that sounds a lot like a description of ripple and xrp. — nathaniel popper (@nathanielpopper) june 14, 2018for ripple, however, the sec — and a growing pile of civil lawsuits alleging that xrp is an unregistered security — remain looming threats. message discipline is a must, and the company has gone into overdrive trying to prove xrp is as “decentralized” as the cryptocurrencies already given a green light by the sec, particularly bitcoin.before we proceed, consider my biases. i own bitcoin, and if its value rises, i stand to gain financially.‘decentralized’david schwartz, the cto of ripple inc., writes on the company’s website that the setup of xrp’s “validators,” which do not utilize “mining,” make the ledger more resistant to bad actors than bitcoin’s.as of today, four mining groups currently control 58 percent of the bitcoin network and three miners account for 57 percent of ethereum’s daily capacity. further, 80 percent of the mining on the bitcoin blockchain is centralized in china, despite the country’s ban on digital assets. this puts it at greater risk of being manipulated by a single, sovereign government. some experts even suggest that in a worst case scenario, miners of bitcoin and ethereum blockchains could use this to their advantage — conspiring to rewrite history on the blockchain through a 51 percent attack that results in verified transactions being unvalidated and allows for fraud to occur. … unlike bitcoin and ethereum — where one miner could have 51 percent of the hashing power — each ripple validator only has one vote in support of an exchange or ordering a transaction.this narrative appears to be a delayed response to a widely-read research article from bitmex, a popular cryptocurrency exchange, which concluded: “the ripple system appears for all practical purposes to be centralised and is therefore perhaps devoid of any interesting technical characteristics, such as censorship resistance.”schwartz addresses this complaint, saying that users can configure their nodes to “users on the xrp ledger select a unique node list (unl), a list of validators trusted by that user… the network has a number of recommended unls, including one list ripple recommends, and users can choose whichever one they prefer or create their own.”bitmex appears to have pre-empted that argument, saying that despite the option of non-ripple unl lists, “there is no evidence that many users of ripple manually change this configuration.”ripple, then, has worked through the year to make its recommendations less reliant on the company’s own servers: “to increase the resiliency and diversity of the network, more than half of the validators on ripple’s recommended unl are operated by people or groups external to the company,” schwartz writes, “and ripple continues to add even more independent validators to the list. this further demonstrates that ripple’s validators do not wield meaningful power over the xrp ledger.”the real issuedid that technical discussion make your eyes glaze over? it’s probably by design. the question of xrp’s technological decentralization, which ripple can take steps to increase, distracts from the token’s economic centralization, which ripple cannot easily wave away.in short, the issue that ripple faces is:1.) when the ledger first launched, the company and its founders owned all xrp.2.) the company has slow-walked the distribution of its xrp reserves. nearly six years later, less than half of the total supply is publicly traded.3.) all xrp enters the market through the company. the company has set a de facto monetary policy for this “inflation” rate.4.) ripple sells its reserves of xrp to exchanges and institutional investors or gives them away for charity and positive press.to understand the extraordinary nature of this approach, we need to understand how it differs from bitcoin’s.the mining competitionbitcoin employs a system called “proof of work” where, approximately every ten minutes, the software saves the most recent state of the ledger in a “block” of transaction information. people running the bitcoin software use their computers to encrypt the newest valid block in a process called “hashing” or, more commonly, “mining.”for the time being, bitcoin does have a programmed inflation rate, or what is called a “block reward.” any time a new block is confirmed, the software gives out a number of new bitcoins to the miner that found it, increasing the ledger’s total balance. when the program first began in 2009, the ledger started with 50 bitcoins, adding 50 more to the balance with each new block. that reward decreases by 50% periodically until it becomes so small (circa 2140) that no new bitcoins will be added to the ledger, capping the total balance at 21 million.people who contribute more hashes have a greater chance of finding a block first and thus getting the block reward, which has led to a profitable market for specialized computer hardware that just spits out hashes as fast as possible. in addition, people will pool their work so that they find blocks more regularly, then split the reward among all the miners according to how much they contributed to the process.the point is, with bitcoin, issuance of new “coins”/credits is a competition that is open to anyone. before any trading or speculation, the software has impartially rewarded new bitcoins to tens of thousands of different people without regard for any aspect of their identities — and despite the emergence of large mining pools, dumb luck still sometimes trumps their overwhelming power. with each block, the mining reward is not pledged to anyone; nothing is guaranteed until a competitor emerges victorious.and the other important facet of this process is that the bitcoin block reward does not enrich any other party besides the miner. the software only receives cryptographic hashes that validate transactions and increase the network’s security in return. no company gets compensated for the issuance of new bitcoins unless they find a block and receive bitcoins.xrp’s central bankby contrast, xrp does not utilize proof of work. its total balance of 100 billion credits was immediately available at the ledger’s genesis. at the time of their creation, there was no competition for those digital credits. all of the xrp made available to the public has been issued through the company and its founders. in the crypto world’s parlance, this is called a “premine.”and since ripple is the issuer of xrp, it was able to unilaterally set an inflation rate for the token. currently, the circulating supply is less than 40 billion xrp, according to coinmarketcap. in december 2017 — shortly before its incredible bull run — the company locked up 55 billion xrp in escrow, to be released at a rate of one billion per month, then re-locking whatever was not sold at the end of each month. ceo brad garlinghouse wrote on the company’s blog, “this lockup eliminates any concern that ripple could flood the market, which we’ve pointed out before is a scenario that would be bad for ripple!”but why would an immediate doubling of xrp liquidity be “bad for ripple”?ripple sells xrp for pure profit; an agreement between the company’s founders explicitly states that the xrp credits (20 billion for themselves, 80 billion for the company) had no value at the time of the company’s incorporation. whether through strategic partners, programmatic sales, or through its licensed money business subsidiary, ripple gets cash for xrp. the company has every incentive to push the token’s price as high as possible. selling, per their figures, an average of 300 million a month above 15 cents for 4+ years will net them billions of dollars — much more than selling 55 billion xrp for the likely sub-penny price that an immediate dump would cause.when ripple distributes xrp for free, it is typically to the company’s benefit — whether by raising awareness of their product early on with a giveaway or by announcing classroom supply donations to the press. an april report by bloomberg alleged that ripple offered to loan $100 million of xrp to coinbase, the largest u.s. exchange between bitcoin and fiat/bank currencies (coinbase listings typically lead to massive price surges).izabella kaminska of the financial times compares ripple’s issuance of xrp to an exchange-traded fund: “it is entirely centrally controlled, operating more like an etf unit than anything else since the issuer has the capacity to release or absorb (pre-mined) tokens in accordance with their valuation agenda.”in contrast, a statement from the company says that the escrow plan contributes to the decentralization of xrp: “ripple has escrowed its xrp such that it only has actual access and control of 13% of the actively traded xrp. the terms of the escrow are such that ripple will likely never have outsized control of the outstanding xrp [emphasis added].” note the necessary caveats — and the failure to address ripple’s central issuance.ripple representatives often say, “if ripple the company shut down tomorrow, xrp will continue to exist.” and while this is technically true of the network/ledger, we don’t know what would happen to ripple’s escrowed xrp — at least half of the supply. the company’s press contact did not respond to questions on that subject.a simplified graphic illustrates the difference between these two digital assets’ issuance models.note that there is no interaction between bitcoin’s software and markets — because distribution is handled in the code. since xrp’s code does not address distribution, aside from a single genesis account that holds all xrp, that process is centrally controlled by the company.this claim to “decentralization” is one of several ways ripple is trying to fight off regulators by obfuscating on its relationship to xrp. stay tuned as we explore these other defenses in the coming days.', 'do you believe in god? would you put your cryptocurrency holdings on it?augur, an ethereum-based platform for betting on the outcome of real-world events, aims to be a repository of crowd-sourced knowledge for journalists, investors and policymakers, as well as an effective tool for hedging against adverse outcomes.but its also become one other thing: a hilarious place to troll.forums for questioning a higher power are just one of many markets that currently exist on the decentralized prediction market, developed by the non-profit forecast foundation and funded with one of the worlds first token sales in 2015.that token sale took place before people were even using the word initial coin offering, or ico, to refer to these types of crypto fundraising schemes, and the project went through the ico boom in beta – with the developers testing and vetting one of the most hotly-anticipated launches in crypto history.as such, when it launched on ethereums live blockchain last month, it briefly surpassed the most famous decentralized application, cryptokitties, in terms of the number of users. although enthusiasm has since dipped markedly.so far, most of augurs markets – and the vast majority of the trades on the platform – deal with relatively vanilla topics like the outcomes of sporting events or the prices of crypto assets. but a few take a truly dark turn, gauging the likelihood that prominent figures will be assassinated or that terrorist attacks and mass shootings will occur.others, though, are just goofy, evoking the cryptocurrency communitys peculiar obsessions, wild rumors and the sorts of riddles a bridge troll might ask before letting you pass.so heres to the augur users who have selflessly donated their time and potentially their funds – market creators post a bond in the platforms native rep tokens, which they lose if a market is deemed \"invalid\" because the outcome cannot be verified – all just to brighten their fellow users days.in no particular order, here are a few of the weirdest markets on augur today.vitaliks girlfriendvitalik buterin, creator of ethereum, the worlds second-most valuable blockchain, enjoys the kind of wealth and notoriety few 24-year-olds have.but does he have a girlfriend? and if not now, when?these questions have vexed the crypto community enough to spawn a dedicated article – one thats apparently been viewed over 18,000 times. and now, indelibly etched into buterins own creation, theres an augur market for it too.buterin himself must confirm the relationship, according to the markets terms, and the couple must have been together for at least one full day.its worth noting here that (as with many augur markets) nobody has bet on this one at the time of writing.are you there, god?ostensibly, augur markets must be based on verifiable events, but augur is a platform without moderators, so thats become more of a guideline.as mentioned above, the perfect example: someone has posed the question, \"does god exist?\"theyre apparently in no hurry to find out, as the market expires at the beginning of 2020. and the resolution source must be the \"news media.\"the heathen users that initiated the market give the creator of the universe a 10 percent chance of existing. no money is at stake at the time of writing.safu or not safunaturally, augur users havent passed up on the chance to sprinkle the platform with their particular flavor of memes.titled \"funds are safu?\" one market references a bizarre – but popular – youtube send-up of binance ceo changpeng \"cz\" zhaos attempt to reassure users that their crypto holdings on the platform were safe.looking at the markets details, however, it appears not to be a joke, but a serious – if vaguely worded – question about whether binance will be hacked: \"will the security of https://www.binance.com/ be negatively affected such that there is a newsworthy loss of money?\"the market expired without any bets having been placed.does not computecompetition is stiff, but the trolliest market currently active on augur may well be this restatement of the liar paradox – the sort of query one might use to incapacitate a murderous supercomputer.for the uninitiated, the statement \"this sentence is false\" is a paradox because, if the statement is, in fact, false, that means it checks out. so its true.if the statement is true – by being false – then it violates its own premise: it has to be false.thinking about this paradox goes back to at least the fourth century bce, making it one of humanitys longest-running time wasters. adding a pinch of circular meta-salt to this concoction, the market creator made the point of reference for this market predictions.global, a site that scrapes data from augur.the pee tapethe allegation that russian authorities possess compromising material on u.s. president donald trump is one of the stranger stories to emerge from the 2016 election.the existence of this compromising material – originating from a collection of documents prepared by a former british intelligence officer working (indirectly) on behalf of democrats – is often known as the \"pee tape\" due to its alleged content.but it hasnt been proven.judging by an augur market on the topic, though, chances are around one in four that such a tape will emerge before the end of trumps first term.betting volume on the market has been very low, however, at the equivalent of less than $60.mcafees bold predictionmany of the most liquid and valuable markets on augur deal with the prices of cryptocurrencies.so at first glance, its hard to see whats remarkable about one particular market predicting that the price of bitcoin will pass $1 million before 2020.but theres a clue in the fact that its tagged \"mcafee.\"the anti-virus-software-creator-turned-cryptocurrency-hype-man has published many inadvisable tweets. topping the list, however, is one from late 2017, when he predicted that bitcoin would hit $1 million and reiterated a promise hed made earlier to \"eat my dick on national television\" if he proved incorrect.yet

bought 2 iphones a year ago, but can only buy 1 today. it gets even worse when you look at a wider time frame.turkey, one of the biggest countries in terms of population ( #19 ) and in terms of economic power ( #13 ), is experiencing a serious economic crisis, which is mostly fueled by the current politics.usually when a country messes up the economy, the central bank will try to stabilize the currency and contain the crisis, while taking massive losses, until they eventually run out of power and give in. this causes the value of their currency to start rapidly decreasing. this is happening to turkey and the citizens are aware of it. turkey has a history of having an economic crisis every decade and the older citizens remember converting all their paychecks into usd or gold as soon as they got them because of hyperinflation. this crisis was a bit overdue and a lot of economists were expecting it.a lot of turkish citizens just started to realize that turkey has entered a “bear market”. no one wants to keep turkish lira, people are panicking and they want to exchange it for usd, or gold as soon as possible. if this bear market continues for another 6 months to a year turkish citizens will convert most of their savings into other currencies.however the local media are manipulating the numbers and giving false information about the economical situation of the country. also it seems like some banks are not allowing the citizens to buy foreign currencies, though they allow them to sell foreign currencies. this trend might spread to other banks and eventually the citizens will only have gold as a safe place to store their wealth. while gold is an excellent long term store of wealth, it does pose some problems when the whole nation is trying to buy it: there isn’t enough gold for everyone, resulting in massive price increases in a small geographical area.3 year timeline - 1 gram gold to turkish lira graphso, buying foreign currencies are discouraged by the governments and banks, there isn’t enough gold volume for everyone-how will the citizens of turkey store their wealth?the answer is digital gold: bitcoinit seems we are seeing the beginning of the bitcoin trend: while most cryptocurrency exchanges have lost significant amount of volume after january, exchanges in turkey have started to gain volume in the last few months. while the turkish banks are displeasing customers, turkish cryptocurrency exchanges are offering them a way out.let’s explore what might happen if this trend continues for a few quarters.bitcoin 24h volume is $4bethereum 24h volume is $1.5bturkey’s gdp per capita is $10.7kturkey population is 80mturkey internet users are 53mapparently 31% of south korean workers have invested on average 3 months worth of salary into cryptocurrencies. while koreans are fast adopters in technology, turks are fast adopters in methods to transfer try into other currencies. turks also have an entrepreneurial risk taking culture and are very interested in making easy money via ponzi schemes and other means. furthermore turks are hodling about $200b worth of gold under their pillows. keeping private keys under a pillow is the digitization of this tradition. there is also a research by ingbank that indicates 18% of young turkish professionals own bitcoin.if 20% (10.6m) of those internet users in turkey decided to put 3 months worth of salary into bitcoin, that would mean $28.3b money entering the cryptocurrency market, slowly, consistently over time. at this time bitcoin has a market cap of $111b and another $28b entering will increase the market cap by $100b-$500b. about 10% or $10b of bitcoins are actively traded. if $25b were to enter into a $10b market, the price is likely to triple taking the market cap to around $350b. this happens because of the gap between inflow and market cap.if turkish people start using cryptocurrencies, the price of bitcoin and every other cryptocurrency will increase significantly. this will result in technical analysts and trading algorithms getting bullish signals about the market and causing them to invest too. this will cause media all over the world to get interested in bitcoin prices again, resulting in new people getting into it. initial coin offerings, youtubers, bloggers, will have more money to spend on marketing and they will reach a lot more people.this cycle of events could eventually lead to the biggest economic bubble humanity has ever experienced.or none these may happen because the turkish government might start “discouraging” the purchase of cryptocurrencies too. oh wait they already have:turkey’s central bank @centralbank_tr made an infographic video on cryptocurrenciesmaybe we shouldn’t allow countries the luxury of screwing

active participant in the cryptocurrency market and has his / her own view on all the events.today we present to you the article of sergey petrik, the co-founder and chief sales officer of the umc project, on the situation in the cryptocurrency market. the article is based on sergey’s personal podcast in cryptotime.sergey called his new podcast “depression”, because no one knows what we should expect on the cryptocurrency market in the near future. he shared his thoughts on the most important events of the cryptocurrency market, the prospects of growth and the future of crypto world. we should consider the opinion of crypto experts and follow the news.the 3rd monthly report of the chinese gov for its cryptocurrency rating index was released recently. despite having banned icos and crypto trading in september 2017, china’s ministry of industry & information technology has launched a rating index. eos is positioned again first and leading while ethereum follows second. the ranking puts a new cryptocurrency komodo in the top 5 blockchain platforms. thus, i believe that it is worth investigating komodo in more details.i think that the cryptocurrency market will start growing again in september-october 2018. many analysts claim that 2017 was almost identical with this year. in summer 2017, all crypto forecasts were pessimistic and a few people believed in cryptocurrency. at the same time, an ico boom also took place in summer 2017. many users have invested in icos, which had a huge profit. i believe that this scenario will happen again.vitalik buterin, the co-founder of ethereum, believes that the value of cryptocurrency may be seen in regular, small-scale everyday spending. in a private event in san francisco last week, he spoke on the future of cryptocurrencies, remarking that he would be happy to pay for goods and services with bitcoin cash. i do not know whether buterin has ever met roger vere, but his statement will definitely cause resonance. every statement of opinion leaders and crypto gurus has a very strong influence on the crypto market. buterin also mentioned that he believes icos to be “old and boring”, past their prime as a financing model.currently it is very difficult to work on the ico market. as you may know, i am the co-founder of umc, the project which is coming to the ico market in the near future. our team has already finished a pre-sale and a closed round of the token sale. in september 2018 we plan to launch a public token sale. that’s when we plan to present our project capabilities, mvp, partners. umc is the story of a real business. we plan to create the first advertising exchange in social messengers. you can order any advertisement in the world’s top messengers (viber, whatsapp, telegam and others) and use the technology of smart contracts on the umc platform. umc will act as guarantor of the transaction between the buyer and the advertiser. today this niche is very promising; we will solve many problems related to guarantors, copyright, discount token, etc.moreover, each state will introduce its own national cryptocurrency very soon. state representatives all around the world are considering the possibility of creating their national cryptocurrency: study blockchain and its applicability in a real life, gather a team of professionals. sooner or later they will create a model that will be applicable in different countries. perhaps it will be swiss or maltese model. malta is considered to be the silicon valley for cryptocurrencies.today, most bitcoins are bought outside the exchange. we do not see much of the turnover, even coinmarketcap does not show real numbers and does not add a lot of coins. on coinmarketcap you can find 2000 currencies, while there are more than 10 000 on a real market. many new exchanges appear on the market. i think that there will be many exchanges like binance on the market, which will make a real revolution.the representatives of wolf street believe that bitcoin is a good way to store money. bitcoin does not have any other functions. the psychological barrier of $6,000 is very important. if bitcoin’s price falls below $6,000, then this will be an important psychological factor.now i’m drawing a positive picture of the cryptocurrency market. technologically, this will be the most correct approach, because during the dot.com collapse, when 90 percent of companies ceased to exist, the remaining 10 percent — google, amazon, yahoo survived and brought their holders a huge profit.', 'wednesday, august 22, 2018 at 8:57amdecentralized systems will continue to lose to centralized systems until theres a driver requiring decentralization to deliver a clearly superior consumer experience. unfortunately, that may not happen for quite some time.i say unfortunately because ten years ago, even five years ago, i still believed decentralization would win. why? for all the idealistic technical reasons i laid out long ago in building super scalable systems: blade runner meets autonomic computing in the ambient cloud.while the internet and the web are inherently decentralized, mainstream applications built on top do not have to be. typically, applications today—facebook, salesforce, google, spotify, etc.—are all centralized.that wasnt always the case. in the early days of the internet the internet was protocol driven, decentralized, and often distributed—ftp (1971), telnet (<1973), finger (1971/1977), tcp/ip (1974), uucp (late 1970s) nntp (1986), dns (1983), smtp (1982), irc(1988), http(1990), tor (mid-1990s), napster(1999), xmpp(1999), and [email protected](1999).we do have new decentalized services: bitcoin(2009), minecraft(2009), ethereum(2014), ipfs(2015), mastadon(2016), dat (2018), and peertube(2018). were still waiting on pied piper to deliver the decentralized internet.on an evolutionary timeline decentralized systems are neanderthals; centralized systems are the humans. neanderthals came first. humans may have interbred with neanderthals, humans may have even killed off the neanderthals, but theres no doubt humans outlasted the neanderthals.the reason why decentralization came first is clear from a picture of the very first arpa (advanced research projects agency) network, which later evolved into the internet we know and sometimes love today:where wizards stay up lateeveryone had a vision of the potential for intercomputer communication, but no one had ever sat down to construct protocols that could actually be used. it wasn’t bbn’s job to worry about that problem. the only promise anyone from bbn had made about the planned-for subnetwork of imps was that it would move packets back and forth, and make sure they got to their destination. it was entirely up to the host computer to figure out how to communicate with another host computer or what to do with the messages once it received them. this was called the “host-to-host” protocol. -- where wizards stay up lateall that existed were hosts talking directly to each other over a primitive network. centralization didnt exist. tcp/ip didnt exist. nothing we take for granted today existed.this fit the design goals. the early internet was all about sharing data:taylor had been the young director of the office within the defense department’s advanced research projects agency overseeing computer research, and he was the one who had started the arpanet. the project had embodied the most peaceful intentions—to link computers at scientific laboratories across the country so that researchers might share computer resources. ... building a network as an end in itself wasn’t taylor’s principal objective. he was trying to solve a problem he had seen grow worse with each round of funding. researchers were duplicating, and isolating, costly computing resources. not only were the scientists at each site engaging in more, and more diverse, computer research, but their demands for computer resources were growing faster than taylor’s budget. every new project required setting up a new and costly computing operation. ... and none of the resources or results was easily shared. if the scientists doing graphics in salt lake city wanted to use the programs developed by the people at lincoln lab, they had to fly to boston. -- where wizards stay up lateback in those days of high adventure hosts were far more than mere pets, they were golden temples where crusaders came to worship speaking prayers of code.today, servers arent even cattle, servers are insects connected over fast networks. centralization is not only possible now, its economical, its practical, its controlable, its governable, its economies of scalable, its reliable, its walled gardenable, its monetizable, its affordable, its performance tunable, its scalable, its cacheable, its securable, its defensible, its brandable, its ownable, its right to be forgetable, its fast releasable, its debuggable, its auditable, its iterable, its easier to usable, its easier to onboardable, its copyright checkable, its gdprable, its safe for china searchable, its machine learnable, its monitorable, its spam filterable, its value addable.depending on your point of view, decentralization is few of those things. and many of those \"features\" are exactly why we like decentralization in the first place.whats more, consumers simply do not care. users use. only a small percentage have the technical sophistication to understand why they may want to preferentially use decentralized applications for technical reasons. saying \"its like x, but decentralized\", does not resonate, especially when the services are not as good. we had decentralized slack way before slack...yet theres slack. you know its bad when github managed to recentralize an inherently distributed system like git.there are certainly niche reasons to use decentralized systems, permissionless anonymity being the primary use case. can you trust the likes of facebook or google? history says absolutely not. but most people dont care.what might constitute a turning point back to decentralization? i can think of several:complete deterioration of trust such that avoiding the centralization of power becomes a necessity. radically cheaper cost basis. it becomes fashionable. the decentralization community manages to create clearly superior applications as convenient and reliable as centralized providers. geographical isolation. neanderthals live alongside humans. parallel, separate, not worrying about whos equal.(1) seems more possible than id like to admit. see chinas digital dystopia.(2) still on the horizon. cloud computing will follow the same downward cost curves as everything else.(3) well have to get the kardashians on that.(4) will be difficult. by their very nature iterably improving decentralized applications is like herding cats. its much easier to add features to centralized applications. sure, napster was a great way to share music, but isnt spotify simply better? yes, i know, spotify can shutdown tomorrow and then where are we? im with you. but most arent.(5) the problem is the earth is too small. global centralized applications are buildable today. something i missed on completely. when we go to space that wont be the case. applications in the space age will have to redecentralize...at least until the ansible is invented.(6) we have genetic material from the neanderthals. we can rebuild them. we have the technology. this time maybe its enough that neanderthals survive alongside humans, not going extinct, ready for the time when humans need a fresh infusion of genetic material...or when neanderthals become alpha.so thats what i believe now that i didnt five years ago. how about you?related articles', 'despite all the political talk about 1% and 99%, the economy is more like 10% and 90%, with plenty of professionals such as doctors, programmers, executives and creative people who do pretty well in that 10%. this chapter is about how to be in the 10% and not stuck in the 90% low paid gig economy. this book will help with the bottom of that venn diagram, figuring out where the puck is headed, so that you can get on the right side of the disruptive changes coming during the blockchain economy.this is part five of the blockchain economy serialised book. part five is where we focus on working in the blockchain economy – whether as an employee or contractor. part 5 only has one chapter because we refer back to parts 1, 2, 3 and 4. also we have no ambition to write generally about career/work advice; this is specific to working in the blockchain economy. for the index/table of contents of the blockchain economy book please click here.the book is now in the editing process. if you would like to be an early reviewer and help shape the final version before it goes on sale, please send an email to bernard at dailyfintech dot com.this chapter covers 5 key questions that employees or contractors need to ask:are you entering or re-entering the workforce or a nervous incumbent?where is your market in the creative destruction 7 act play?where are the agile incumbents with proven ability to ride disruptive waves?where is the intersection of those 3 circles?how to be a contractor with clout after disruption hits your employer?are you entering or re-entering the workforce or a nervous incumbent?if you are entering workforce from school or college, you may have about 40 years of work ahead of you and hit your peak earnings years in about 10 years.the main advice to somebody entering the workforce is don’t sweat it, because nobody can predict what the future of work will be like, but also don’t listen to anybody who is only telling you where the puck is today. 40 years ago nobody predicted most of the jobs that we do today, somebody urging you to get into a business that is hot today, may not be helping you think about what the world pf work will be in about 10 years time when you are hitting your peak earnings years. assuming you don’t want to be an entrepreneur and start your own venture (if you do, please read part 4), the best advice is to work for a great entrepreneur. at what stage you choose to work for that entrepreneur will depend on your risk appetite. at one end of the risk appetite you want to be an early employee and make a fortune from success compensation (such as stock options and tokens). if that is your appetite you need to think more like an entrepreneur and so you should read part 4. beware of survivorship bias. for every story of early employees making fortunes at a places like google and facebook are 100x of stories of those who worked for less than market rates who made very little on success compensation. so you must think like an investor, because you are investing your time. you need to build a portfolio over your working life. at the other end of the risk spectrum is somebody who just wants a good paycheck and benefits, which means working for a big established firm. the only trick there is making sure your big established firm is not slap bang in path of the disruption (e.g. working at blockbuster when streaming video was going mainstream).if you are re-entering workforce after raising children, being laid off, a sickness or some other life event, the key issue to navigate is how to leverage your great experience of how things work today when everything is changing so fast. you want to find a company that:is late enough to pay you properly. you don’t want to be earlier than act 3 – that is too high risk for your life-stage.early enough that they value your legacy knowledge. in the earlier acts, your legacy knowledge is hugely valuable to the founding team, much less so in the later acts.so, in the earlier acts you take on more risk but have potentially more reward – just like an investor.if you are employed in a big established firm but you have the nasty feeling that your employer is facing disruption – welcome to the world of the nervous incumbent. for example, you do not want to be at kodak when digital films hit the market or at blockbuster when streaming movies came along. the advice to nervous incumbents is to jump before you are pushed. it is much easier to get good work if you leave before the mass layoffs.in all three cases – entering, re-entering or nervous incumbent – you want to have a clear view of where is your market in the creative destruction 7 act play. this book is an aid to your own creative thinking that will help you think through where your market is in the stages of disruption.where is your market in the creative destruction 7 act play?whether you want safety (not getting crushed by a tsunami) or thrills (surfing a big wave) you want to make sure you know where the the wave of change is and where it is headed. one way is to read this book, particularly part 2 where the established markets are described. then look at where is your market in the creative destruction 7 act play.although history does not repeat, it often rhymes. you can spot these patterns throughout the history of disruptive waves of change. we call this cheat sheet the creative destruction 7 act play.creative destruction 7 act play is written from the perspective of the incumbents (which tells the disrupters what to do (see part 4). the creative destruction 7 act play helps you to spot where your market is today.act 1. the old guard dominate.this is when a few big companies dominate a market that has not fundamentally changed for decades. mergers, debt leveraged acquisitions and “roll-ups” have locked the old guard into behemoth structures. no entrepreneur would think of competing against these companies and, if they did, no investor would back them. with so many waves of changing hitting at the same time (blockchain + ai + iot + mobile etc), there are very few markets like this any more and it depends on how you frame the market. for example, the oil business is in act 1, but if you view the oil business as one segment of the energy market, it is more like acts 4 and 5. for those entering the workforce, this is to be avoided. for the nervous incumbents, only act now if you have a compelling alternative, there is no immediate threat. for those reentering the workforce, these behemoths can still survive for 10+ years so if that is your time horizon they can be a good bet, but be aware that rehiring laid off executives as consultants/contractors will be your competition.act 2. straws in the wind. this is when a few visionary/crazy entrepreneurs see opportunity. occasionally vcs get active at this stage, but all too often vcs are part of the established order and do not see enough reason to believe that the times are changing. it takes guts to see a few straws blowing about and bet that this is caused by an invisible wind. the signs of change are far from obvious but “the answer my friend is blowing in the wind”. this is where icos, a blockchain innovation, is changing early stage capital and that is further accelerating change because it is easier now to raise capital at this stage. bitcoin, for example, was in this phase around 2011 and ethereum was in act 2 in 2014. for those entering the workforce, act 2 is great if you can work for a great entrepreneur. for the nervous incumbents, this is an early warning sign and you should get out now if you are reasonably young. for those reentering the workforce, act 2 is good if you can find a great entrepreneur who will value (pay for) your experience of how the market works today.act 3. denial. the changes are now real and the old guard management can see it, but they don’t know how to react so they reach for high pressure management to make the numbers work. in some cases, management also reach for creative accounting tricks to smooth out earnings and make it look as if nothing has changed (known as fraud in most circles). this act can go on a long time as most investors work on surface numbers. a famous example of the denial act 3 was subprime mortgages that blew up in the global financial crisis in 2008. for a long time the surface numbers looked good until a few nonconformists looked below the surface (watch the big short for an entertaining take on that story). a more recent example in finance was the wells fargo fake accounts scandal (which was going on for a long time before it was uncovered). for those entering the workforce, act 3 is a great entry point; you just need to find a great entrepreneur to work for. for the nervous incumbents, this is where you can see the signs internally that the outside world cannot easily see, so it can be a great time to act. for those reentering the workforce, avoid the incumbents in this phase as their behaviour will be unpredictable; it will all look calm on the surface, while the reality is chaos.act 4. the weird turn pro. the crazy entrepreneurs who started at act 2 are now gaining real traction and major amounts of capital. they are experimenting frenetically to find what is really sustainable/scalable. this is the time “when the going gets weird, the weird turn pro” (quote from hunter s thompson, who was certainly weird but also professional enough to write best-selling books). during this act there are lots of stories in the media about these strange entrepreneurs but, as the old guard numbers still appear to be ok, the accepted wisdom is still that nothing will fundamentally change. for those entering the workforce, act 4 is the best risk-adjusted entry point. for the nervous incumbents, you may already be too late; keep an eye out for the mass layoffs heading your way. for those reentering the workforce, the entrepreneurs who are weird turned pro are ideal clients/employers; they have the budget to pay you and know that the devil/god is in the details that you know.act 5. blow up. this is when reality can no longer be glossed over. this is when we see scandals such as wells fargo fake accounts and news corp phone hacking. this can lead to investors taking a cold hard look at the numbers and when the new numbers do finally appear, it can trigger a stock crisis, often with a restatement of earnings and a change of ceo.at this stage the reality can no longer be denied and we see real crises in big companies. these crises may lead to radical transformation, or they may lead to chapter 11 restructuring and fire sales. before that happens we see the kind of behavior we just saw with wells fargo (which went on a long time during act 3, denial, when hardly anybody was paying attention). this is new for banking, which has not had a major headwind like this in hundreds of years. however, bankers can study other markets that got hit by the digitization truck – for example media. when corporate pressure hits reality, we get act 5 blowup. for those entering the workforce, act 5 is a bit late but there are very good jobs on the right side of disruption. for the nervous incumbents, this is already too late, just get the best lay off terms you can. for those reentering the workforce, there are a lot of opportunities among those scaling fast.act 6. reconstruction. this is when a new power structure starts to emerges. this is when we see ipos from the visionary entrepreneurs who started in act 2. sometimes they stumble post ipo and never recover. sometimes they stumble post ipo, recover and grow to strength – that was the famous story of priceline after the dot com nuclear winter. for those entering the workforce, act 6 is good if you want a relatively low risk job; the companies that started in act 2 are now hiring a lot and have decades of high earning years ahead of them. for the nervous incumbents, this defines your job search. for those reentering the workforce, it is hard but not impossible to show value for your legacy experience.act 7.the new incumbents. many entrepreneurs make the mistake of seeing how quickly the new guard arose and think that they can also be deposed quickly. the entrepreneurs who made it to this stage will be tenacious, paranoid and really hard to beat – until the next wave comes along. for example, in the centralized internet era we have gafa (google, apple facebook, amazon) and bat (baidu alibaba tencent) who deposed analog media and bricks and mortar retailers and will dominate until the decentralized internet gets to prime time. until that happens, don’t bet against gafa and bat. for those entering the workforce, act 7 is low risk/low reward. for the nervous incumbents, your target list of future employers is smaller and each has a tough hiring process. for those reentering the workforce, the new incumbents will pay for specific knowledge/experience but there is little upside.where are the agile incumbents with proven ability to ride disruptive waves?there is a myth that incumbents always lose to startups during waves of disruptive change. when you look at what actually happened, you usually see a really dumb move by an incumbent that snatched defeat from the jaws of victory and gave the market to the startup. the two most famous stories are:ibm handing the pc market to microsoft. ibm did not understand that the real value creation was in the software operating system.blockbuster handing the streaming video market to netflix. blockbuster did not understand that netflix in those days was quite vulnerable and could be easily acquired or crushed.there are very few companies with a proven ability to ride disruptive waves. one is the aforementioned ibm. having learned their lesson from losing the pc market to ibm, the great turnaround under lou gerstner put in place the the culture that ensured customer-centricity no matter what the wave of disruption was. now ibm is a big player in ai, blockchain and iot, while keeping a laser focus on serving enterprise customers and having crystal clear financial metrics to judge their performance and to guide capital allocation.you can see the same in intel and goldman sachs. what all three have in common is a succession process where the right ceo emerges to ride the next wave of disruptive change.there are very few companies like this. a more common story emerges from companies such as yahoo and aol, which struggled to thrive after a new wave of disruptive change hit them.as an employee, assume that most incumbents will be hurt by disruptive change, no matter what the pr machine says; but you can bet on the few that have proven ability, across multiple ceos, to ride disruptive waves.where is the intersection of those 3 circles?although charles handy wrote the empty raincoat (making sense of the future) empty in 1995 at the dawn of the digital age, he describes the changes coming to our society very well and handy rightly bears the title of visionary. this quote is timeless:“the empty raincoat is to me, the symbol of our most pressing paradox. if economic progress means that we become anonymous cogs in some great machine, then progress is an empty promise.”or as a t shirt proclaims “the matrix was a documentary”.the takeaway from the empty raincoat is that you should do work that you love, that is fulfilling for you. however the old line about “do what you love and the money will follow” is too simplistic on its own. just ask many a struggling musician, actor, writer or artist. on the other hand, getting a lot of money for work that you hate so that you can be “nothing more than something you invest in” (bob dylan) is not a recipe for a good life. you need work that is in that venn diagram between work you love and work that pays well.the problem is doing that during times of disruptive change. your employer going bankrupt sure impacts the “pays well” part of the venn. that is why you need to look at where the puck is headed, not where it is today. i wrote this book to help answer that question.how to be a contractor with clout after disruption hits your employer?when incumbents get to act 5 in the creative destruction 7 act play there are a lot of layoffs. if you are nearing retirement this can work well. you get a nice severance package and you may get rehired as a consultant on a short term contract.if you are younger and facing mass layoffs, your options are worse. to avoid being a low paid gig economy worker, driving a taxi or doing tasks for those with good jobs, you need to do two things:first, jump before you are pushed. if you see “the writing on the wall” you can be out and into the job market while your experience is still prized. wait till the layoffs and you will be on the wrong side of supply and demand. read this book to see “the writing on the wall” before your colleagues.second, reinvent your personal brand. a linkedin profile is no longer enough. you need to drive your personal brand through all content marketing channel, so that you tell the market what you know.bernard lunn is the ceo of daily fintech and provides advisory services to companies involved with fintech (reach out to julia at daily

(eips) for the upcoming constantinople hard fork.the meeting started with a discussion of the latest updates on the processes of no-proof blockchain tests and the progress achieved on major eth clients, with one of the devs explaining that there is a need to revamp some of the testing to avoid potential consensus issues.this week saw the release of a number of new features; however, the devs noticed one instability with a “huge” major miner rewrite, which is supposed to be solved by the next update. by monday, the devs are planning to push out another release “to have the whole thing completed” and finalize the mining release issue.in terms of the constantinople hard fork, hardly anything has changed for the last two weeks, according to the meeting. the devs reported on several bug fixes and new tweaks for the testnet, also noting that eip-1211 will not be included in the upcoming hard fork.the devs also came to a decision that it is far better for the network to stay on schedule and release new hard forks in time, as opposed to rushing with involving new eips or delaying those ready for implementation at the expense of the ones still under development.speaking about the possibility to have a second hard fork if it is “really hard to get the changes bundled for all eips for constantinople,” one of the devs said:“if we delay the time, we would want more features to this particular [constantinople] hard fork and we should discuss if it’s good to have many changes in one fork, or it’s better to have less changes in many hard forks.”the devs also decided to release new hard forks every eight months after the constantinople hard fork. the proposal of a release every six months was rejected as it would create too much pressure for the devs team.further discussion was devoted to the issue of adding a “difficulty bomb” and its impact on the reduction and maintenance of block rewards. according to the devs, eip-858 would reduce block rewards to 1 eth per block, eip-1234 would reduce block rewards to 2 eth, while eip-1295 would keep rewards to 3 eth but will affect other factors such as the proof-of-work (pow) incentive structure.in order to determine which of the three possible scenarios is preferable, the devs called on the community members. some of the participants pointed out the environmental impact of eth mining, while others insisted on decreasing profitability or even excluding asic miners from the eth network. in the end, the participants in the discussion could not reach common ground, so the devs decided to hold another meeting next week on august 31.as of press time, ethereum is currently trading at around $281, down almost 10 percent on the week and 41 percent on the month.', 'companies kik’s kinit app now lands on ios

successful $100 million ico.the unique quality of the kinit ios application is the way it allows all blockchain transaction to take place natively within the app. other popular wallets like coinbase don’t provide this facility, instead directing all crypto transactions to their exchange platforms.the kinit application is lightweight, user-friendly, and hosts all the basic features. once the application is downloaded, setting up a kin wallet is just a few steps away. after this, users can engage with interactive quizzes and polls to earn their kin tokens.kin tokens grab a lion’s share on ethereum platformlast month, kik launched the kinit application on google play for android users. the launch has been hugely successful so far, reaching 15000 downloads on the android platform just within a month’s time. currently, kin is the most active digital currency surpassing the number of active users of the entire ethereum’s dapp (decentralized apps) ecosystem.as the kinit app migrates to the ios platform, the number of active kin token users are surely expected to multiply further. to expand the kin ecosystem further, the company recently approved 40 developers as a part of the kin developer program.the kin marketplaceto drive more users to its platform, the kinit application provides incentives in the form of kin tokens for completing survey, polls or solving puzzles. most of the polls are conducted by kik partner swelly, a polling chat bot. the rewards are sponsored by redbull and swarovski, who are currently testing user engagement through digital currencies.being a part of the kin ecosystem also allows users access to the kin marketplace. here they can spend their kin tokens on gift cards from brands — retailers and other channel partners like amc theatres, amazon and google play. additionally, kin token users can also make payments amongst themselves via the kinit app.kik is not the sole player with a vision of integrating digital tokens to its messaging services. behemoths like telegram and facebook are already exploring several avenues on a similar approach.what are your thoughts on kinit’s migration to ios? let us know what you think in the

the world by the end of the yearhow do we know, and are you sure you’re not nuts?kin is a very misunderstood cryptocurrency. in light of this, i have chosen to highlight it once again and expand on my previous claim that kin will be the most used cryptocurrency in the world by more carefully walking through what it takes to achieve this, explaining what kin is, bringing you up to speed on what kin has accomplished since my first article, and adding a deadline, as the confidence around the claim has increased with what we now know.and yes… i’m sure.youbefore continuing, download the kinit app. trust me. earn your first kin (30 seconds) and then follow along with the article. you will get it. *us only.kinit. download it or else.for the newbies: what is kin…i’m going to break this down into steps and walk you through each piece.kin is a currency token.like bitcoin, kin’s main function is the transfer of value between users. it is not designed as a platform for other tokens. unlike bitcoin, it is not a coin, as it is not its blockchain’s own native digital asset. it is an application built on top of another blockchain (actually two, i’ll get to that).kin is not focused on the physical worldthe physical world runs on dollars, and for the most part, it works pretty well. users generally don’t have a problem with this. they get paid in dollars. they spend in dollars. there’s no real demand to fix a problem that users don’t really have. today, if i want to spend bitcoin, i have to purchase bitcoin with usd, spend it on something, and then the merchant has to convert the bitcoin back to usd to pay their bills. it doesn’t make any sense.besides, who wants to spend a currency that could be worth twice as much tomorrow, and who wants to receive a currency that could be worth half as much tomorrow? nobody. and it’s not for a lack of trying. we have been trying to get people to buy their coffee with bitcoin for a decade.“it’s not a technological problem. it’s not a user experience problem. it’s a logical problem.” — ted livingstonkin is concentrating on the digital world. instead of spending kin on things that have a dollar value, kin is being assigned to things without an inherent dollar value, like stickers, chat themes, a quality group chat, digital weapons and armor, other unlockables, and other abstract digital goods and services.you don’t think about the exchange rate of usd/yen whenever you purchase goods, and you shouldn’t when spending kin either. so essentially, kin is kickstarting a new digital economy as the internet’s native currency.kin is an ecosystem token.you’ve probably figured this out by now, but i have to drill it in because there is a mis-kin-ception that kin is only a “kik-token.”kin is not just kikkik is a billion dollar established tech company that created the kin token and is using it in their app, but it is not only used in kik. kik is merely the launch pad.it’s also important to note that kin is a decentralized currency in an ecosystem of centralized apps. decentralized consumer apps suck, frankly. centralized kik is better than decentralized kik. centralized snapchat is better than decentralized snapchat. and at the end of the day, mainstream users don’t care about decentralization, if they even know what it means. all they care about is fast, frictionless, interesting features, and a great user experience. we can improve on that experience by aligning the incentives of the app developers with their users via a decentralized currency shared between apps, and i will explain how.you can earn it .like bitcoin, you can earn kin. but the ways you can earn it are different.bitcoin is brilliant. it offers everyone an equal opportunity to get rewarded for their contributions. everyone plays by the same rules of the game, and everyone is fairly rewarded in a trustless way. bitcoin rewards miners for the computing power they contribute to solving an arbitrary math problem. effectively, you are rewarded with bitcoin for burning electricity.damn, yobut what if we could take the same concept of fairly rewarding contributions, and instead of burning electricity, we reward value creation?kin has the kre.kin has a decentralized incentive protocol to drive mainstream adoption — something that no other cryptocurrency in the world has. it’s called the kin rewards engine (kre).instead of inflating the supply by rewarding miners for burning electricity, kin inflates via value creation. developers of apps who adopt kin are incentivized to create new features and experiences in their apps to maximize the transaction volume in kin through user-to-user interaction. the kre pays out a fixed amount of kin each day and divides it up proportionally to each app in the ecosystem based on the transaction volume that they generated. read that one more time and then continue.kin is a fundamentally new way to monetize.now that developers can be paid via the kre, their incentives are aligned with their users. this means developers no longer have to show their users advertisements or steal and sell their data to make money. they can make money simply by making a great user experience, and their users can even be rewarded for contributing valuable content. and now, for the first time ever, app developers can work together as a collective unit to compete with facebook and google, who monopolize the advertising model of monetization and “copy and crush” everyone else.…and how do we know it will be the most used crypto by the end of the year?to answer this question, we first need to know what it takes to be the most used crypto:currently, the most-used cryptocurrency in the world is steem. it has ~60,000 daily active users (dau) and does ~1.2 million tx/day.that’s it.no really, that’s it.pitiful, right?a decade of blockchain technology and this is what we have to show for it.okay, cut to the chase.kin is being adopted by a ton of apps, several of which have active users in the millions.kik alone has 15 million mau , which translates to a few million active users per day., which translates to a few million active users per day. imvu has 5 million mau. they even have a growing active marketplace for content creators built into the app already.on top of these, there are forty (read: 40) other apps that are adopting kin this october, and will be live in the app stores. you can check them all out here. this is courtesy of the kin developer program, and this is not the only one. there will be a second batch, perhaps before the end of the year, where developers will have a shot at being early adopters of the currency and rewarded with approximately $120k each (going by the first one). of these apps, nearby has over 5 million downloads on android, and several other apps have hundreds of thousands of downloads. this is only the beginning.there is also the kinit app that you hopefully already downloaded. this is sort of like the main hub and wallet, where you can discover the other apps in the ecosystem and use it as just one of many places to earn some kin in exchange for your time. it also has a few spend options. more spend options will exist in the future, but for now, you’ll have to settle for amazon gift cards and the like (wow that really sucks).current standingkin currently has over 9000! dau.this is more than all ethereum dapps combined (really setting the bar high…). that is how pitiful cryptocurrency is in the eyes of mainstream adoption. almost all of these active users are just from the kinit app. kin is also available in kik, but it’s in private beta, and not many users have access to it. of the users that do have access to it, they only have chat themes as a spend option. kik is quickly improving the experience with an agile and iterative approach to meet market fit as quickly as possible. “move like the wind.”soon, kik will be open to the public, fit with all the bells and whistles it needs, and kinit will begin to go global as they exit the public beta stage and adapt the user experience beyond users in the us, beginning with canada and expanding into europe and asia.deep breath. furthermore, kin is developing an sdk with unity to bring kin to mobile game developers and quickly expand the ecosystem.all of this together absolutely shatters the current most-used record. and what’s more impressive is that it will be by mainstream consumers, not crypto enthusiasts.“i have been involved with kin since the early stages of the project in 2017, as it continues along the path to become the cryptocurrency for consumer apps. kin has a unique value proposition, as it unlocks new growth and monetization strategies for developers, and based on its first integrations, i truly believe that kin will drive mainstream consumer adoption of cryptocurrency.”-william mougayar, former special advisor to the ethereum foundationyou forgot to talk about the two blockchains thingright. so a big part about being the most used cryptocurrency in the world is that you need a blockchain that can handle it. currently, ethereum cannot handle it alone. it’s not fast, it’s not nearly scalable enough (kin alone would crash it instantly), and it’s not cheap enough. but it does have two good qualities: it has liquidity, and it is decentralized and secure.to complete the puzzle, kin forked the stellar blockchain to create a scalable, fast, and fee-less blockchain. stellar-fork kin is placed in the app for users, and they are creating an atomic swap to the erc20 kin to get the best of both worlds.a quick note on potential “competitors”steem, mithril, bat, reddcoin (lol), and others like this are kind of similar to kin. but not really.steem is a single platform coin with nowhere to grow. mithril is also a single platform token, no installed base of users, and still doesn’t help developers monetize. bat has an installed base of users on brave, but it’s not user friendly (none of these “competitors” are). also, bat wants to pay users for watching ads. kin is creating a new way to monetize without ads. it’s just not the same. bat is counting on your mom and dad, brother, and sister to enable ads in their browser and watch them for money instead of just using an ad blocker and continuing with their lives. bat also doesn’t create blockchain wallets for you. they just give you bat that you can store in your own wallet that you create yourself (consumer experience nightmare). do i have to touch on reddcoin? kin is really the only horse in this race. compare the user experience of the kinit app (have you downloaded it yet…? seriously, 30 seconds. come on.) to this:the nightmarenobody has a reward system like the kre. nobody has an installed user base anywhere as large as kin’s by a long shot. nobody has a scalable blockchain for mainstream consumer apps. nobody has a system of getting apps to work together to compete against the monopolies, and align the incentives of the developers and their users. nobody else is in the race.you’re still reading?so there you have it. by the end of the year, kin is going to dwarf the crypto space (there are only about 6 million active crypto users total). with millions of users earning and spending kin in an ecosystem of apps, kin will have more utility and demand than any other cryptocurrency. period.look out for the headlines.', 'aaron
